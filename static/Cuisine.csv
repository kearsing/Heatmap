Belgian,Order a Piraat at the bar.  Worth four stars alone.  
Belgian,The Belgian beer on tap selection is impressive.  The space is a bit small but well decorated and comfortable.   Lighting is above-average and the bar area by the front window provides entertaining people-watching.  Great date place.  
Belgian,We ordered the mussels and frites (the house 'specialty').  The mussels were sizable and cooked well but the sauce (always the best part of mussels) was a bit too buttery and salty for my taste.  The bread was very crusty and tasty and the frites were decent (I've had better Belgian frites).  I still like Sardine's mussels better but these were decent.  
Belgian,Overall well-run and a great addition to the neighborhood.  Again just say Piraat at the bar - worth the trip alone.  But watch out 10% alcohol with a smooth finish can be dangerous...
Belgian,What first attracted me to Brasserie V was the ample selection of Belgian beer.  I was pleasantly surprised when I entered to find an adorable well-lit almost romantic establishment serving some pretty tasty food.   Our server was very helpful in aiding us through the list of beers -- as my dining companion wasn't really a fan of beer in general. (and we successfully found one that both of us enjoyed)  The bread is served with a seasonal herb butter -- it was green and oh so delicious.  I had the house special mussels and frites.  I was a little disappointed that I had to shell my own mussels but the work was well worth it.  My dining companion had the steak and frites. She described the steak as tender and enjoyed every morsel of it.  
Belgian,The restaurant is small I am not sure if I would ever bring a group of people here.. however it would be a great place for a date or a double date.
Belgian,Visiting the Brasserie V after about 2 weeks after its opening and then about 2 months later one word jumped into my head immediately.  Inconsistent.
Belgian,The service and especially the food wavered in quality and delivery.  Starting with the first visit I was taken as a surprise with the place still in its infancy mellow feeling as if word of its existence hadn't really gotten out yet.  Upon returning those several months later the place had become lit darker much louder (due to the fact it was packed) and complete with a long wait as there are few tables.
Belgian,"Now I'm not one to complain about noise nor about having to wait but it is truly loud inside for a small restaurant and if your host informs you its only a fifteen minute wait and it turns out to be more around double don't continually string them along telling them ""Just a few more minutes.""  Recall what you told those waiting and address the fact you were mistaken otherwise gauge more time than you think it will take.  Telling groups their wait time is low only for it to be over double starts a sour note before menus are even in hand.  Unfortunately the minimal wait space inside does little to help those table-less."
Belgian,Okay now before I begin spilling out one of those prototypical long tirades complaining about rude wait staff undercooked orders and long wait times perhaps the best way for me to reflect may this tried and true form.
Belgian,The Good: Their more affordably charged sandwiches were the highlight item each time I recommend the one with mustard.  I actually don't like mustard but this was very rich without being overbearing very close to amazing.  A very nice Belgian beer selection although a bit expensive one of these won't kill you and if the place isn't completely  jammed and the bald man at the bar is feeling nice he can help point you in the right direction if you're feeling overwhelmed.  
Belgian,The Bad: The much hyped frites are simply thinly cut fries slice and dice it how you will because sliced and diced they are still fried potatoes and not a lot more.  The tri cups of dipping sauce that accompany seem to exist to enliven these knowingly dull snacks but they should be more flavorful or evolved.  Besides the above mentioned wait-times the servers seemed very distant and non-communicative while not rude when in a loud restaurant the server should assert themselves over the noise letting you know you're of value and you're noticed.  Sometimes when feeling swallowed up the lack of server presence is much more estranging than typically felt.
Belgian,The Ugly:  Upon both visits the lamb was ordered and requested beforehand to be cooked more than rare.  Both times returning marginally more than rare causing two send backs the second time.  Above all get the meat cooking instructions correct.  For whatever reason of confusion this looks extremely unprofessional. 
Belgian,I'm going to give the Brasserie a pass here in memory of the better food and experience I had the first time and hope that as time goes by they can tighten up some of these hitches.  You can see the potential for it to really sail and just soar but for the ambiance and the dollar its dangling between disaster and dazzle.
Belgian,Visiting Madison my friend took me there because of its reputation for a outstanding selection of Belgian tap beers. The beer menu offers a lot to try out and explore. The friendly staff allows you to sample them if you are not sure what to order or want to compare. 
Belgian,The interiour design comes close to an authentic brasserie atmosphere. Open kitchen in the back makes it lively. 
Belgian,I've not experienced any rude service as in the review above. Unfortunately we didn't get to check out the menu or try the food since the wine and beer list was already consuming our full attention.   
Belgian,Within Europe Belgium has propably the highest density of top restaurants and certainly the biggest variety of beers. Madison can be very proud to this little Belgian embassy!!!
Belgian,Brasserie V definitely deserves 5 stars for  taking the risk and creating this great contribution to Monroe street!
Belgian,The food at Brasserie V is generally good but service is hit-or-miss which means your meal may be lukewarm by the time it reaches your table. Being with a group of four or more exacerbates the problem. That said I thoroughly enjoyed the BBQ Pulled Pork ($9) and the Grilled Chicken & Blue ($8.50) sandwiches I had for lunch on two separate occasions. If you're there for Sunday Brunch try the 4-Layer Crepe with Nutella ($9) or the Smoked Salmon Benedict ($10) with a cup of perfectly brewed Alterra coffee.  Note that portions tend to be on the light side.
Belgian,This is one of my favorite Madison restaurants.  The best part are all the delicious Belgian beers on tap.  You can try all sorts of different flavors and be amazed by them all.  In addition the food is very delicious.  The menu is small but they do everything on it well.  I had a special which was a sliced sirloin on top a parmesan potato puree which was amazing.  I have also had lunch there which is cheaper and still very good.  The place is small so it is sometimes hard to get a seat but it also makes it quite cozy.  The only problem is the service can be a bit slow.  You just have to flag waiters down to get things.  Overall a great restaurant.
Belgian,"Been there like three or four times each time it's great.  I think I had the mussels with chorizo once and was like ""so what"" but every other time it's been a really good meal.  I really like their bolognese with the pepper farfalle.... it's really about as good as that could be.  The frites: above average not perfect... but honestly that isn't a magnet to me anyway.  The beers: excellent.  They're heavy on the Belgian selection as they should be but there's always a couple I haven't had before... come Grand Cru or this or that.  Sometimes it's pretty busy... I'd recommend eating early there isn't a lot of tables there.  I dunno how people go 2 stars on this seriously... I mean I think 3 is starting to get bad.... 2 really?  Maybe if you don't like beer... but that's like going to a pizza place knowing you hate pizza.  How many times you been there... try it again goddamn."
Belgian,There was just nothing not to love about Brasserie V.  
Belgian,We had a table of 6 with only 5 people arriving on time.  Our missing friend ended up being about 45-60 minutes late and we did not order food until the latter half of that time frame.  Sure we ordered beers but we felt bad about absorbing a lot of table space on a busy Saturday night.  The waitstaff didn't even give us the stink eye.  They were pleasant (downright friendly even) and professional.  
Belgian,"Allow me to rhapsodize about their beer selection.  I was overwhelmed and elated by it.  I'm pretty sure that I have never seen such an extensive beer list.  They have something like 10-15 Belgian beers on tap (and like 50+ in bottles) complete with the appropriate fancy glasses to serve them in.  I am kind of a whore for drinks being served in the correct glass (which was my one beef with Tex Tubb's margaritas--a rocks glass?!  Come on!).  I would highly recommend the ""Saxo"" and ""Poperings Hommel Ale.""  That Poperings....man oh man.  It was the most perfect beer I've ever tasted.  All of the beers that my dining companions had (both dark and light) were also phenomenal.  I'd also like to point out that if you request it you can get as many samples of the beers on tap as you'd like.  Seriously."
Belgian,"I tried Moule et Frites and in no way was I disappointed.  They bring you a medium-sized mixing bowl full of mussels drowning in a garlic-butter sauce.  Cue drooling here.  They then plop down a huge metal cone full (FULL) of perfectly cut spiced and cooked frites.  Oh sweet jesus.  While I was face down in my bowl of mussels I heard things like ""This steak is $@*&$!% fantastic"" and ""Ohhhh the beer braised kale.""  Nobody was less than 100% enamored with their food."
Belgian,On top of everything else the place is charmingly decorated.  It's cozy and warm and beautiful.  I love it and need to go back right away.
Belgian,What did Monroe Street ever do without Brasserie V?  I'm astonished at how unbelievably busy this place was straight out of the cage.  The beer selection is its signature and quite good.  The food is typical bistro and also quite good.  But seriously kids buy yourself a few more restaurants in Dudgeon-Monroe.  The west-siders are desperate to EAT OUT.
Belgian,Note: I'm adding an extra star here because I hear the chef bailed and opened his own restaurant down the street.  Poor form dude.
Belgian,A- OK. 
Belgian,The most pleasant part of this restaurant was the hostess's greeting at the door. She was very friendly and welcoming. Something I always expect from any restaurant but it's one of those things that's hard to perfect. 
Belgian,"Let's discuss about the food. The special of the day ""Scallop salads"" was ok. I would not give more than 3/5 for this dish. Although the overall taste was good the salad was over dressed and the scallop had little too much salt on the surface. Entree? I ordered braised beef short ribs with balsamic glaze. It sounded tasty but again little excessive on salt and it tastes nothing special. Worse than that I don't think it matches the price and all the raves they've been getting."
Belgian,The dessert menu needs to be re-worked. Maybe they can incorporate fresh seasonal fruits or something. As of now it looks terrible.
Belgian,Waitress's service was on the slow side but nonetheless very pleasant. She could recommend me a decent glass of wine to go with my dish. And oh yeah the atmosphere was pretty nice. I loved the decor and while it's not pretentious it somehow induces the right amount of intimate feeling. So if their cooking skills and the menu improves this place could easily be a repeater.
Belgian,The atmosphere was a classy subtle elegance and dark wood decor.   The Belgium beer selection was top notch and stems to match. We didn't eat there but I will definitely return for a meal. The french fries looked like they'd fulfill my addiction. 
Belgian,Cheers!
Belgian,Love the updated menu. I've had 3 of the sandwiches over the past 3 weeks. Every one of them was good. Most recently there with colleagues from out of town. Great service and food. All my friends thought the whole package was great.
Belgian,I'm a huge fan of Belgium beers--based solely on their beer selection Brasserie V would be 5 stars. However their food is pretty inconsistent and at times very mediocre. They have a different lunch and dinner menu--the lunch being my favorite of the two with some pretty fantastic sandwiches (the apple and provolone is my favorite). The one consistent thing on the dinner menu is the mussels and frites. They're hands-down the best in Madison. Paired with a Belgium beer or two and you've got an amazing night out. The vibe in the restaurant is great--busy and lots of energy. However the wait & bar staff is pretty hit-or-miss. Overall really great--but not perfect.
Belgian,A great selection of beer and delicious food. Only down side is that it doesn't fit many people.
Belgian,This was a toughie. I want to give the food a three and the atmosphere a five...four it is. The Brasserie V is a very charming little restaurant with a great long bar. They have a huge list of Belgian beers and a carefully selected wine list. Two members of our party opted for sandwiches (both great and incredibly well priced) we had an order of frites for the table (plenty for four!) and my mom and I split a few appetizers as our dinner. 
Belgian,Now I must say I was truly disappointed with the cheese plate. If this is your thing resist the temptation! The cheese plate IS my thing but I didn't know any better. First our selections could not be well explained to us what we chose was not all that great (except for the Hooks 10-yr cheddar) and the accompaniments of bread crackers sugared walnuts and olives was simply confusing. Maybe it's just me but I like my cheese plates with honey almonds quince.... 
Belgian,Aside from the cheese I loved the prosciutto wrapped asparagus with poached egg (yummy and charred) and the scallops with pesto were silky if not a bit too salty. Both were small servings (a given for appetizers) but we probably would have left a bit hungry if we didn't finish our companions sandwiches for them. 
Belgian,Overall I would be back to try to make some better food choices...it's just so darned cute!
Belgian,I had been hearing good things about this place most importantly: the frites.  I've known some good frite:  I used to work 5 blocks away from pomme frites in NYC and have basically tried all their toppings.  
Belgian,I love the fact that it's a stone's throw from the trader joe's and the neighborhood is precious.  The pedestrian walks have flags you can pick up and drop that you can use to cross the streets; parades can happen ANYWHERE.  
Belgian,So we went after 1ish and it wasn't too packed but noticed there were only two servers.  We weren't in a rush so I thought it would be fine. We ordered and since the husband whose first love in potato wouldn't share we each got an order of frites.  Husband ordered the cheeseburger our friend Kate got the reuben and I got the avocado BLT.  
Belgian,And then we waited and waited.  I had to order coffee or else I was going to pass out.  I had just finished a hip hop class so I was starving.  Their beer selection was impressive with husband pointing out that they serve Wychwood beer from his hometown in the UK.
Belgian,When we finally got our orders I noticed the portion of frites were huge and regretted not sharing them with Kate.  I also noticed that a) husband said no tomato and look! tomato and b) the avocado was missing from my AVOCADO BLT.  It took some time to flag the waitress and then she apologizes and brings a plate of sliced avocado for me.  I was like 'um great i get to assemble my own sandwich'.  I drowned out my grumpiness in frites doused in mayo because fat makes everything okay.
Belgian,We felt guilty because we over heard the waitress tell a table that they had run out of frites.  We had ordered the last ones.  But then I thought hello? it's your signature dish--how can you run out?
Belgian,Anyway...I would try it again and see how the dinner menu goes and taste their booze.  The food was pretty tasty the service not so much.
Belgian,***Okay...FIRST off let me just say that this rating is based on the food and atmosphere alone because I am NOT a beer girl. If I was I'd probably dig it because they have a very...VERY extensive selection.
Belgian,We decided to have dinner here after I had a long hard day at work. I almost wish I had chosen another place just because it was soooo loud due to the lack of walls or sound buffers of any kind. This place is small but they still pack in the people and it was just a bit too much.
Belgian,"When we arrived the hostess told us that they were having plumbing problems and it would be about a half hour until we could order food. We decided to stick to the game plan and sat at a table. The waitress came to get our drink order and said ""Well it could be a half hour or an hour...who knows. Hopefully they're fixing it."" Now when you're hungry there is a big difference between a half hour and a hour or ""who knows"". She did say that they could make frites however. We decided to order those as a starter but before we could even do so she said that everything was fixed and the kitchen was open. YAY."
Belgian,We still went for the frites to split because we know they're known for them. I'm not sure what I was expecting on the menu...but nothing looked amazing to me(except the Moules et Frites) so I decided to go low-cost and  went with the Avocado BLT subbing the chipotle-lime aioli for the regular mayo that it usually has. The sides were succotash chilled red pepper soup or potato leek soup. I love leeks so I chose the latter.
Belgian,The sandwich was okay but nothing amazing--but a BLT is pretty much just that unless it totally sucks.. Same for the soup. It was almost too thick. The frites were decent and I liked the beet aioli that came on the side. Again it was just so-so in a town with so many dining establishments that so-so doesn't do much for me.
Belgian,I don't know if I'd ever go out of my way to dine here but it was decent.
Belgian,I like this place...  
Belgian,As everyone pretty much knows Brasserie V fills up quick!  Its very small and the atmosphere is very cozy (unless you get sat at the table by the door in winter).  Come early to experience the beer and wine selection well waiting for your table! 
Belgian,Every time I go here I get the Frites.  Ahhh yum I can taste the dipping sauces right now. Don't let them skip out on serving you bread because you ordered an appetizer.  The butter for the bread (or in my case frites) is too good to miss. 
Belgian,I love their duck entrees and I usually get that every time I go.  Its nice that they switch up the menu but I really enjoyed the duck leg served over greens vs the new casserole duck entree.  Its still very good though! Just don't burn your tongue! 
Belgian,Service overall was good.  The hostess was super friendly and helpful.  We actually sat at the bar to eat instead of waiting for a table. Best thing is since you are at the bar your bartender/server is always right there on top of everything.  Eating at the bar I think you get faster friendlier service. Plus you can figure out what your favorite new Belgian beer is. 
Belgian,* * If you like the beer selection here I would recommend trying out the Malt House on E. Wash.  But don't go the the Malt House hungry...  they don't serve food.
Belgian,Brasserie V has an EXCELLENT selection of beers some of which you can't find in even the largest liquor stores in Madison. Their frites are simply amazing and their meals have also never disappointed me. However eating here will be anything but cheap and some of the portions have been very small. It has also been very crowded and it can be tough to get service at times. I would suggest Brasserie V for a quick drink and order of frites with friends that is when this place truly shines.
Belgian,Similar atmosphere to Jac's down the street but the food is much better. Also excellent selection of fancy beers. Very small restaurant! Love the atmosphere!
Belgian,Bravo! Done right from top to bottom...great beer frites organic and local meats! Friendly and competent service and cool upscale atmosphere. A bit noisy but one of my favorite places in Madison.
Belgian,"Wow!  I had the best meal here.  It was pretty crowded even on a Thursday night so we started off at the bar with some drinks while we waited for a table.  They have a great beer list and my wife really hit a home run with a Sam Smith Organic Strawberry beer.  My wife had the ""V Burger"" and claimed it to be the best burger she's ever eaten.  I had the cod and it was a perfectly balanced entree with a superb piece of fish.  We also had a cheese plate and the pork cheeks for appetizers and they were great.  Can't wait to go back!"
Belgian,They serve a lunch menu on Sunday nights.
Belgian,Had a great lunch here today. 5 stars for Ahi Tuna sandwich with a side of curry salad.  May have to go back tomorrow.
Belgian,"Wow. What a great place guys. It's just so easy to get drunk off the atmosphere and enjoy how great the food is I think it might be fair to say their ""V Burger"" is the best burger you'll ever have. Better than my dad's for sure!"
Belgian,Best gastropub in Madison by far.
Belgian,Brasserie V is one of those places that (to my taste) just gets everything right.  Great craft beer selection but with a focus on Belgians. Excellent locally sourced food with the menu updated seasonally.  
Belgian,Their double fried frites are the best in town.
Belgian,The menu does change seasonally but there are some popular staple items that are left untouched mainly steak frites and the moules frites along with a selection of sandwiches. Almost all of which I've tried by this point and I've yet to have a bad meal here. As other reviewers have mentioned this place set a new bar for what I think a burger can be. The V Burger is definitely the best  burger I've had in my life thus far. Hopefully something I will continue to experience in the afterlife as it tastes like heaven.  (hint: it's likely the combo of the burger juices that mix in with the aioli that take this burger to the next level) . Their cheese boards are a great cross-section of primarily Wisconsin produced cheeses.
Belgian,I would argue that Chef Rob is one of the best chefs in Madison as to an amateur observer what comes out of the kitchen is always very consistent and nearly always perfectly prepared - even if Chef Rob himself is not in the kitchen. To me that means that all of the kitchen staff actually care and want to succeed in making good food. That makes a lot of difference!
Belgian,The service is generally very friendly and attentive. And although I've had some slow service when they are quite busy I can understand that. Slow service certainly isn't the norm though so no points lost from me.  
Belgian,Expect to wait for a table during peak hours sometimes up to an hour or more as the place is absolutely tiny. I have no problem waiting for anything from here though it's made up for in the quality and deliciousness of the beer and food on offer.  My tip? Sit at the bar if it's busy. Or if you have a long wait put your name on the list and go grab a beer or glass of wine at Barrique's Wine Cave while you wait.
Belgian,It's also not uncommon to see Matt the owner tending bar during dinner hours and socializing. He's a very nice guy and passionate about beer. A great fountain of knowledge.
Belgian,They also occasionally offer up beer tastings and educational sessions where you can learn about beer. I've attended a couple of these and had a fantastic time learning about the origins of some of their european and belgian beers. 
Belgian,The lunch menu is a bit more limited and provides mostly their salads and sandwiches but there is typically a good special on offer.
Belgian,One reviewer mentioned they only have the lunch menu Sunday nights. This recently changed and they now have the full menu available on Sunday evenings.
Belgian,Excellent Wisconsin Belgian beer & fare delight. Atmosphere was cozy classic/elegant with a twist of sophistication. The pommes frites were some of the best I've had as well as aioli. My friend got the an amazing salad that he couldn't finish (really- it was deceptively large!) and I tried the gnocchi (larger than usual) with mushrooms and cream sauce that was delicious. I wish we were more in the mood for beer tasting since the listing was impressive...
Belgian,Madison needs more gastropubs it's true. Brasserie V is here to answer the prayers of the people. Great beer list amazing and decently priced wines. Best mussels and frittes I have had in ages! Excellent service. And was the perfect setting for a romantic date! I will be back!
Belgian,I'm getting hungry just thinking about that dinner it was exceptional.
Belgian,I love this place. It is an excellent sort of upscale place to go. You do have to wait a while if you go there on a busy night but it is def. well worth the wait. I will def be returning here. The beer is great and the food prices are also very reasonable.
Belgian,One of our absolute favorite restaurants in Madison. Can definitely be crowded and the wait can be long but the food is great! Very inventive and the extensive beer list impressive. Also good selection of wines.
Belgian,i find the fact that brasserie v's website opens with a definition of the word brasserie (an unpretentious restaurant) HILARIOUS. because if I could use one word to describe this place it would be pretentious.
Belgian,i met some friends here for drinks last weekend. we only stayed for one drink because the prices were outrageous. this might not bother the monroe street richies but i know that there are several other bars in this town that serve the same beers without hiking up the price.
Belgian,to be fair I didn't try the food... so i *might* come back if my pockets are feeling particularly deep. however if you're on a budget know that there are several other places in town that have a similar (if not altogether better and more reasonably-priced) beer selection.
Belgian,I seem to have a thing for picking small packed restaurants to try on Friday nights...
Belgian,We waited for over an hour as we were told we would. Since we were at the bar it was completely fine. As everyone else has said the beer list was almost overwhelmingly long. I can't make decisions ever so I went with (overpriced) Riesling. It was delish. An odd thing though: I guess they reserve seats at the bar because once a couple got up and we slid in to grab their seats the bartender informed us that they were taken and reserved. Hmm.
Belgian,At the table we got the V Burger I V Burger II and 2 orders of moules frites plus the pommes frites as appetizers. The garlicky aioli was amazing... the pesto aioli was slightly odd with the fries but still good. My friends ate their burgers in .02 minutes -- evidently they were tasty. The mussels were also very good although slightly bland. I got ginger-pear fritters with creme anglaise for dessert which was very very fried and heavy. Not my favorite. We also got the chocolate pie and this won our hearts. Thick dark chocolate creaminess on top of a cookie crust. What could be better?
Belgian,3 starts because although the wait was long the staff was friendly and helpful the food was quick once we sat down and the bar kept us busy through the whole wait. But... the dessert was such a disappointment.  I would try it again maybe with just one other person.
Belgian,Overall...  great place to hit on a Friday night for drinks and fries at the bar.
Belgian,We stopped in for late afternoon drinks a plate of frites and split the burger.  I was impressed from the moment we entered.  There was a chalkboard near the door which listed the names of the servers and bartenders for that shift.  That was a nice touch and I wondered why more places don't do something similar.  The bartender was friendly and attentive.  The beer was spot on and food was great.  Will definitely be back.
Belgian,I have been going to Bras V once or twice a month for years now and while the wait time is occasionally an annoyance and I have had one or two disappointing meals the beer and frites simply are unmatched in Madison.  
Belgian,In particular the Belgian taps are the stars of the show in my opinion if you are not ordering off the first page of the drinks list you are doing it wrong though their wine selection is supposed to be good I can not speak to that.  The price is steep though as I tell my cheaper friends when you are drinking a super tasty 11% beer you do not need more than one or two.
Belgian,The food has varied over time with some seasonal hits and misses.  The frites are the best in Madison best I have had anywhere really and pretty much every french fry I eat is a mild disappointment comparatively.  For lunch the BLT is excellent and the turkey sandwich is sometimes quite good but is more variable.  For dinner the mussels are my current favorite though they seem much less intense than they used to the broth used to be buttery and rich to the point of almost being too much the last few times it has been much lighter.  I have also enjoyed the steak it's not a fancy cut for the price but the sauce and side with it are quite good.  The burgers are quite tasty and refined though not quite as good as the Bad Breath burger at The Weary Traveller.
Belgian,One thing I have not tried is the cheese/sausage plates.  From what I have seen they are not impressive for the cost and being a native around here I can have the same cheeses at home with money left over to buy an Abt12 next time I am at the Brasserie.
Belgian,The bf brought us here for Vday.  Had scallopsbf had steak both were high quality and extremely tasty.  I loved the ambienceserviceand wine.  Must go!!!
Belgian,Most unique beer selection in Madison. Very friendly & knowledgeable staff behind the bar. Go on Tuesdays for 3 of the most incredible sliders you've ever tasted. And don't skip the French fries.
Belgian,Friday afternoon lunch time and the place was full.  We waited for a spot at the bar and soon discovered that we were one of the few in the place that were not regulars.  It was like Cheers they knew what people wanted before they even sat down.  Soon we were made to feel like family.  We ordered frites dh had the V burger and I had the Avocado BLT (we both had a few beers as well...peche lambic and dh has a few different ones).  When the food came the bartender remembered that DH ordered his burger medium (when the burger comes from a farm like Fountain Prairie Farms you can do that!) and saw that it was more med well and offered to take it back.  When he said he would eat it the bartender went right to the window to tell them to make sure they watched the product.  
Belgian,What could be better...Belgian taps amazing dry aged burger Nueske bacon and organic greens.  Thank you Brasserie V!!!
Belgian,I love BV. I went there for lunch with my dad last week. Such a nice place to stop and have a bite or a drink or why not both! Great service and such yummy food. Frites to die for!
Belgian,"Appalling service I took 4 guests who parked separately. The hostess sat 2 at a 5 top while I waited for my guests (under five minutes) and then made us wait for 45 minutes for the next table because ""we were not all there"". When I complained they made no apology and no effort to even buy us a drink just ignored us. Not worth it."
Belgian,Went to Brasserie V last night for dinner. 
Belgian,The not so good:
Belgian,-The House-Made Cavatelli was really a disappointment.  It looked and tasted like Hamburger Helper.  The pasta was fresh but overcooked and the sauce really didn't taste very good.
Belgian,-The chorizo on the duck didn't make sense and was WAY too overpowering.
Belgian,Overall I will go back and recommend it but they really need to rework the Cavatelli. 
German,This place is a really off the wall Vegas experience an authentic German gasthaus just off Las Vegas Blvd.  Full bar and great beer on tap - at great prices.  The club is private but you are allowed a limited number of visits without joining.  
German,There is usually a dinner on Saturday nights (check the website for details).  The quality of the meals prepared by the members is good and again the pricing is reasonable.  Non-members can enjoy a meal also.  Just call the club by Thursday to make a reservation.  
German,Absolutely one of my favorite places to have a beer in Las Vegas.  Surreal atmosphere warm and friendly people (almost none of them are German ;))) and delicious German beer on tap!
German,The Club itself (known as the GASCON)  is pretty neat too.  They have a couple boozy golf tournaments a year which are a lot of fun and also do a fantastic job hosting the Oktoberfest in DT Las Vegas.  Annual membership is like $35.  I carry my card in my wallet.  
German,The GASCON is making a push to increase the headcount of its younger members (hold your national socialist youth movement jokes please ;))).  There's talk of using the space on the off nights as a music venue and also of hosting viewing parties for both the US and Germany games at the 2014 World Cup.  I'll be there...
German,Whoa! That's the one word that came out of my mouth exactly 3 times when I walked into this place. I came here because I was in the area and it came up on yelp in the dive bar category. Also being of German heritage myself I thought it might be a sort of mini hofbrau haus. Yeah I was mistaken. Don't get me wrong this is an interesting place and with lots of character. Really though this place has much more of a VFW or local legion or senior citizen center feel to it. I'd take my grandparents here. Hell I'd even take my parents here. Take it from me though you really wouldn't want to bring a date here.
German,This club is great fun nights good bar good food. They are open Tuesday for Jazz Night Friday for card night Saturday dinner and dancing and one Sunday a week for Fruschoppen or Brunch.  Please check out the website of GASCON if you need info.
German,Exploring the city's German fare the BF and I headed over to Cafe Heidelberg the past Friday evening.  Upon entering the waitress looked at us and then the clock.  I asked if they were closing and she said no but we had five minutes to order.  (I guess the last seating is definitely at 8 pm.)
German,Walking past the small market and into the back we seated ourselves into a quaint little booth.  A bunch of older folks filled the other tables and you get the feeling that this is definitely a family kind of place.  (Hofbrauhaus and Cafe Heidelberg are in two totally different leagues.)
German,The waitress handed us the menus and a beverage list.  The food menu is very basic nothing fancy at all.  And the beverage list has a decent variety of beers and wine.  
German,"I wanted spatzle and that's all I cared about.  So I ordered one of the few things that came with spatzle - the Jagerschnitzel ($23) ""Pork schnitzel lightly battered and smothered in a mushroom  wine and onion sauce.  Paired with red cabbage and spatzel."""
German,"The BF was torn between the Mixed Wurst Plate ($23) ""Bratwurst Knackwurst and Bockwurst.  Served on a bed of sauerkraut and mashed potatoes"" and the Oktoberfest Platter ($25) ""A classic pork schnitzel and a jumbo Bratwurst paired perfectly with red cabbage and homemade spatzle.""  He chose the former since I already had the pork schnitzel and spatzle in my dish."
German,As we waited for our entrees bread and butter arrived with our beverages.  We also took a little walk through the market to check out their German groceries and deli.  A limited choice of food items but you'll find your herring spatzel and sauerkraut available here for home.
German,"My pork schnitzel was covered with dark brown gravy and was quite tender.  Pretty good.  The spatzel was okay but maybe it's because I prefer it with a creamier sauce instead like mushroom.  (I think I should have ordered the Kase Spatzle ($16) ""House recipe German noodles smothered with melted Swiss cheese.  Garnished with tomatoes"" instead.)  The red cabbage was blah nothing special but the side salad was pretty tasty.  "
German,The BF's wurst feast came with a side of mustard sauce for dipping and a huge helping of sauerkraut.  The different wursts were pretty good and the sauerkraut was okay.  (Then again I think I'm a fan of it on the colder end and crunchy than soggy.)
German,"They were both very generous orders and we had leftovers to go.  We never made it to dessert which was ""Bavarian Apple Strudel with vanilla sauce"" ($7) and ""Black Forest Cherry Cake"" ($5).  "
German,"Overall Cafe Heidelberg may probably be more authentic German fare than Hofbrauhaus.  They were recently voted ""Best of Las Vegas"" for ""Other Ethnic Restaurant"" again.  So if you want your German fix head on over to Cafe Heidelberg just don't expect the loud music crazy games and the long wait of its competitor."
German,(I added pics of our dinner in the business profile!)
German,"Loved this place a few years back when they had a Chef from the ""Fatherland"" cooking. He was classically trained in Berlin in one of the finest 5 Star Hotels. He then left and they hired everything in between. From a Mexican chef to 'god knows where' from..... Stopped going. Went back a  week ago after hearing the old Chef is back cooking there and.... guess what the food is back to where it used to be. Portions are big tasty and even the soups are homemade. Negatives I have is that the management there really ought to update the interior and also stop raising the prices on the same dishes. Sides go for $4 a piece. Very tourist trappy.... If the Chef leaves again I go where he is going."
German,Very disappointing...
German,My wife & I had lunch here this past weekend and were really looking forward to it as we ate here years ago and really liked it.  I don't know why it's so bad now; maybe they've Americanized the food to attract more non-German customers.  But my wife is from Bavaria and this ain't Bavarian food!
German,The potato soup had absolutely NO flavor whatsoever.  The jagerschnitzel wasn't breaded normally and the mushroom gravy wasn't very good.  The sauerkraut tasted like it was served from a can and NO German restaurant should be serving mashed potatoes!
German,The only good thing about the place was that they had Franziskaner Heifenweiser although they were charging $7 a bottle!
German,And to top things off their prices are very expensive.  Lunch for two was over $70!
German,Great German food in a quaint and cozy space. Even though our server was swamped with a table of 12 and appeared to be the only server in the house service was only a little slow. She recommended a wonderful light German beer Spaten which was light crisp and clean and a great match for our food.  
German,"Being there at 6:30 on a Saturday night we lucked out and were treated to ""live"" entertainment which consisted of a keyboard player wearing some sort of German-esque vest.  It was nice enough background music but over the course of the evening we were amused by the playlist of Hawaiian Mexican and Italian tunes while seeming to lack any German-esque selections.  Odd."
German,Our meal started with a basket filled with soft marbled-rye bread which was very good. Unfortunately it was served with fake butter spread imitation product in those cheap little plastic tubs which added nothing more than a little moisture to the bread. Our soup and salad were both very good flavorful and tasted fresh.  Cafe Heidelberg's house dressing is a light and creamy dill which I thought needed a little oomph of flavor but adding salt and pepper seemed to do the trick.
German,I ordered the Leberkase entree which is something like German spam ... A combo of pork and veal finely ground and formed into a loaf and baked until it has a crispy crust.  Mine was served in the traditional Biergarten style pan-fried with 2 eggs over easy on top - super nom nom good! Served with warm German potato salad which was nicely seasoned with dill and onions.  Cold cucumber salad was served on the side which added a cool and light contrast to my hearty and savory Leberkase.  I also couldn't resist a side of spaetzel (little egg noodle dumplings) with gravy because I am a shameless carb slut.  My BF enjoyed his Jaegerschnitzel entree which was served with a delicious warm red cabbage side and a generous mound of spaetzel.
German,While neither of us are German we both enjoyed Cafe Heidelberg's fare and would recommend it to anyone looking for something different a little fun and a lot yummy for lunch or dinner.
German,Cafe Heidelberg was a diamond. No gem a diamond. Big sparkly good cut and color and at least two carats. Las Vegas has some of the best dining in the world. One of my favorite spots a strip club that will remain nameless employs not one but two Master Sommeliers. Now there are not but less than two hundred of them in the world so why does any one place need two of them? I'm not sure but only in Vegas will you find such a splurge.
German,With all that said sometimes you need to let your hair down. Sometimes it's necessary to leave the glitz behind and just find some good home country motherland my Oma made it this way and her Oma made it that way and dammit that's the way I want it today kind of food.
German,Cafe Heidelberg is just that kind of spot. In a strip mall off the strip and absolutely perfect. Walk in to the Market and take a right into the Bierstube. It's like walking into the basement Bierstube of some mountainside town in Bavaria. Tapestry on the walls? Yes. Dirndl donned bar wench? Yes! Lederhosen sporting accordion player? Oh yeah!
German,Sarah and I took the bus here from Bellagio for the adventure and it didn't take long as it's only a few miles off the strip. But well worth the trip. Our tip: take a cab. But after our short adventure in public transport the large draft Spatens were welcome and cold.
German,We ordered a bit of everything as soon as we saw the food on our neighbor's table. It all looked so good! And with half the guests being regulars and speaking thick native German dialects we ordered more and more. All of it wonderful. Nothing standing out above anything else. 
German,After singing drinking songs downing schnapps with John the accordion player and six beers later we found ourselves broke (having forgotten our credit cards) payed what we could of the tab stiffed the waitress and hoofed it all the way to the strip (Sarah in heels!)...
German,Now looking back feet all blistered and bloody what does Sarah say about Cafe Heidelberg? When can we go back she asks!
German,And this time we'll bring some extra dough to make up for the shoddy tip we left last summer... oops!
German,Authentic delicious German food definitely worth going off the beaten track for!  We had a coupon for 1/2 off a second dinner but it turned out that on Monday they have select meals (mostly pork dishes) buy one get one free!!  My husband and I ordered the Oktoberfest meal (bratwurst and breaded pork spaetzle and red cabbage) and the pork schnitzel (breaded) with mushrooms in a wine sauce (Delish!!) and BOY did we get a lot of food!  We even ate it for lunch the next day because it was so much food!  
German,"Cafe Heidelberg requires a keen eye to spot it (it is across a parking lot and kind of behind another building) but it has a big blue awning with big letters so we found it okay.  They were nice enough to serve us even though we came 15 minutes before ""closing"" - they serve until 8pm then lock the doors so it's best to get there 7:30 or earlier.  They have a market in the front but in the back they have charming little wooden booths and German memorabilia all over the walls.  "
German,Our food came pretty quickly and it was the best German meal I've had in a restaurant and it's definitely the best German food in Vegas.  The staff was very nice and we spoke for quite a while to our server about the shortage of German restaurants in Nevada and California.  
German,I loved their red cabbage... and the mushroom-covered schnitzel was savory... I hope to go back and try their sauerbraten.  I would have if they hadn't had the 2-for-1 deal on their pork dishes.  I also want to try their sauerkraut.  Gives me a reason to go back!
German,You can look for the 1/2 off second entree coupon online or you can go on Mondays to get the 2-for-1 deal or there's also a feast for 2 for $29.95 -- or just go anytime if price isn't a big deal.  Entrees all run about $26 but they are enough food for 2 meals!  
German,Overall - great authentic hearty food save a little dough rather than eating at the pricey hotel restaurants on the strip!
German,I don't understand all the glowing reviews of this place.  The mashed potatoes and gravy were INSTANT and kraut came from a can.  I cannot say enough that for 12.50 someone had better have at least BOILED the potatoes.  Over priced it deserves to be on Kitchen Nightmares.  Unless we just happed to be there on the one day in their history to have used instant and prepackaged things I would pass it on by.  Their kitchen has at least 3 microwaves visible from the dining area and they charge for lunch avg $15 a plate?  No thank you.
German,I went here a couple of weeks ago and I really expected it to be a lot better. It's crazy expensive for what you get. And I think the owners/servers could benefit from taking the food handlers permit class again. They brought the wrong dishes out to my boyfriend and I. Without thinking my boyfriend removed the tomatoes (with his fingers) from the sandwich then realized and remembered he didn't order a sandwich. When the server/owner came over to fix the situation my boyfriend apologized that he already touched the tomatoes the server picked them up off the table and as he walked away he put them back on the sandwich!!! Who would ever do such a thing!!! Luckily when he served it to the other table something was still wrong because he ended up taking it back to the kitchen. Needless to say I will not be going back to this restaurant
German,Add me to the list of fans of this unsophisticated vegas throwback. Located in the same strip mall where Lefty Rosenthal got blown up and lived this is a slightly divey German restaurant that has excellent weinerschnitzel and a hell of a sausage plat. Things are tough these days and their market items have dwindled. I think their bar area may be closed for most purposes and their a little tight with the free bread but gracious when asked for more. The spaetzl is tops too. I suggest staying away from hofbrauhaus unless you're looking for a drunkfest and go here instead. There's a of the beaten path German place in Pahrump that's good too.
German,Hello my name is ougole I come from germany 5years now I came here to eat with my wife of 50 years. The food here is terible it cost me a marrige . Me and my beautiful wife came in here to eat and food was bad when I tasted the food it was so bad that I spated it on the wife she was so mad she yell and kicked me she scream and yell to go to hell this place cost me 107 plus a marriage.
German,Real old world charm awaits as you open the door to Cafe Heidelberg. Service is friendly the food is as German as you can possibly get in Las Vegas. Everything is fresh and you can taste the quality and love. Sure it might teeter on the more pricy side with dinner entres between $21-$27 but frequent Gift Certificates from restaurant.com can make the meal prices a real bargain. They also now serve a $4.99 Euro brat chips and either a beer (Coors unfortunately) or a soft drink in the side bar area. The decor is very quaint and very old world. A gift shop small grocery deli and a respectable choice of beer in the cooler adds to the charm of this place even if you just browse. Wine selection is so-so. Oh and the apple strudel-home made yummy stuff ya. Oh yeah it's also a great place to come if you want to loose your wife ;-)
German,Let me start by saying I'm no authentic German food expert at all.  So I don't know how authentic the dishes are.  I like the food pretty well.  Have gone there multiple times.  Love their German potato salad and red cabbage.  
German,"That being said they get only 3 stars because they are way over priced (go during 2 for 1) for ""doctored"" dishes.  I asked if they make the potato salad and cabbage from scratch and was told no that it would take too much preptime and that the cook ""doctors"" them from premade.  Also our desert was frozen and had to be heated so not fresh there.  For the prices they ask they should take the time to prep food from scratch.  But I do still like the taste they doctor well to me."
German,Also our last visit the table clothes under glass top were dirty and our waitress was rudish and rushing us.
German,very cheerful waitress. talk alot.
German,the food is okay.  I never had German food so I can't commend on it.
German,portion is large.
German,I order a sweet beer forgot the name. it was good!
German,This is great German food - without all of the noise and hoopla of the Hofbrauhaus.  My husband is from Germanyand this is where we go when he wants a taste of home.
German,The staff is friendly and helpful the portions are huge - so go there when you're hungry!
German,I don't care what people say the food was incredible. My German native friend recommended the place. It looks a bit mom and pop which I'm fine with. There are three spaces here; a bar a store and the restaurant.  
German,me and my bf started with 
German,Bavian Potato Soup - so incredibly good
German,And a bread dumpling soup - amazing.
German,Then we shared a Combination Plate #3  for $17.00
German,Hungarian Debreczinger - rather spicy and good. 
German,Bockwurst  - ooo soo so so mouth watering good
German,Knackwurst  - oh so so soft and so good
German,Our waitress was technically born in Germany but was as american as Apple pie. No biggie she was sweet and a great hostess!
German,We bought German Chocolate to take with us as we were so full.
German,In writing this review I realize I have to go back. The food was just that good. And prices were reasonable. Also I found this http://www.citycoups.com/cafeheidleberg.html couple for half off. I'll print it and see if it works. :)
German,Last night my friends and I went to this German restaurant for the first time. I had read ahead of time that the food was good but there was a problem with the service. I completely agreed. Two of us ordered the #1 special-Stuffed cabbage roll and pork. It was very good; although next time I would ask for the gravy on the side. It was a little too much for me. The meal came with the potato soup which was okay. The red cabbage was delicious. I also ordered a side of potato salad that I highly recommend to have them heat up. It was yummy!
German,Finally for dessert we ordered a piece of the strudel. It was so great! 
German,The reason for the 4 stars is because there was only one waitress for the whole place. She was very nice but kept forgetting things. We never got the rye bread basket . 
German,We will go back with a coupon.
German,Never again!!
German,Nobody acknowledges your arrival and you are left kind of hanging at the front door (please wait to be seated sign) until someone finally notices that you are waiting and yells from behind the counter to take a seat anywhere. 
German,It took 10 minutes to even get a beer ordered (bottled Hoffbrau at $8 for a half liter-ouch and no imported draft).
German,The uninspired menu is WAY overpriced for the mediocre quality even if the portions are ample who cares to eat a bunch of slop.
German,I've lived and traveled throughout Germany and this restaurant with an owner who obviously doesn't care about customer satisfaction wouldn't survive for 1 year.
German,I guess if I want to eat German food again in Las Vegas I would have to opt for the Hoffbrau Haus Las Vegas.
German,Go to Cafe Heidelberg at your own risk-you will most likely be disappointed and overcharged.
German,Caveat Emptor
German,I used Retaurant.Com certificates to dine here during my most recent trip to Vegas from Fri. March/25th/2011 to Sun. March/27th/2011.  Since this trip is alll about exotic dining experiences more than sightseeing in Vegas I chose to experiment this authentic German restaurant.  The location was slightly hard to find but it turned out that the GPS we had didn't pick up the part weather it was from East or West Sahara Ave.  I would recommend calling the restaurant before you start driving out here.
German,I ordered Combo Plate #1 with a boiled Bockwurst and veggies as sides.  There were too much veggies that I couldn't finish the plate.  I ordered authentic German coffee prior to the main dish because I was up till 5am in the morning the night before coming in and the waitress highly recommended me trying their German imported coffee which was extremely strong.  However this coffee DID serve its purpose of helping me stay awake for as long as I can throughout the day to make the day count while having a blast on the Las Vegas strip later.
German,My friends ordered other combos and I also brought in another table of 4----everyone loved their authentic German food----yes various selections of sausages is what they are famous for.  Of course you can't have German food without beer; one of my friends ordered another imported beer from Germany and enjoyed it.
German,At the end of the meal the waitress recommended us trying their dessert----we had the Germman style apple strudel which gave me the sugar rush---that helped me wake up for another several hours before I needed more coffee to continue staying awake!!!
German,All in all my 6 friends and I enjoyed our first experience here at Cafel Heidlberg here off the strip in Las Vegas for the first time.  Once again our theme of the trip was:  exotic food experience and this happened to be one of them because I hadn't had German food in a long time.  
German,Pls. do try if you are in the mood for something unusual.  The decorations inside this cafe were extremely cute and in authentic German designs which were hard to explain because you had to be there to see but this Cafe also has their own professional business website which you can find by Yahoo!-ing this restaurant's name.
German,I'm awaiting pictures from friends' camera to add onto this review.  This was a great awesome first experience for me.....
German,Hope all these details help a great deal!!!
German,"Read all the reviews which included highs and lows but decided to try for myself. Well I went last night and was not happy with the food. The service was adequate but the ""German"" food was not what I had several times in Germany. The prices were out of touch for the quality of the food. They were comparable to Hofbrauhaus but the quality was inferior."
German,This is a cool spot if you're looking for a full-on German experience in a low-key setting. There's plenty of kitschy stuff German decorations and staff dressed in traditional German garb. We stopped by for lunch on a Sunday. It wasn't crowded at all -- maybe 4 other people in the whole place -- and were seated right away in a booth towards the back. We had our three year old in tow and the waitress even brought us a box full of toys to keep him occupied. Apparently the owner brings in her kids toys whenever he out grows them and keeps them in the restaurant in case any other kids want to play with them. That's what I call a family-friendly restaurant!
German,As for the food... well I know nothing about German food. I opted for the spaetzle ($11) since it seems to be a popular dish. What came to the table was a large plate overflowing with egg noodles topped with melted Swiss cheese and surrounded by sliced tomatoes. For an additional $4 sauteed mushrooms and onions were added to it. The serving was large enough for two maybe even three people. It was a little on the bland side despite the toppings but still tasty.
German,Their beer list and desserts sounded intriguing (especially the apple strudel) so it may be worth a return visit. You can find coupons on line for buy one get 1/2 off a second entree at http://www.citycoups.com/cafeheidleberg.html.
German,3.5 Stars
German,There are few German restaurants in Las Vegas In fact this is one of two. The other is the Hofbrauhaus which has a completely different goal in mind (attract tourists)  than this more quaint and authentic German restaurant located away from the busy strip and in a small not too flashy shopping center.  The waitress dressed in a dirndle and spoke German (and English of course) We sat is a private and cozy booth near the kitchen.  The food was authentic and absolutely to die for!  German or not you will love the food at this wonderful restaurant/deli. I ordered the chicken schnizel and although I think it could have easily fed three adults from my one plate I ate the entire thing by myself and the mashed potatoes too! Everyone else took half of their meals home and I think ate the left overs for two other meals. I was just so good I couldn't stop!  After dinner we browsed the market side of the shop and bought some other German treats. They also have neat steins and other non food German decor. Es war kstlich!
German,Let me start by saying i purchased a $25 gift certificate from Restaurants.Com like many others did previous to going to Cafe Heidlberg. And if your thinking about doing the same you might want to read this review to make sure you dont feel duped after you get your bill. 
German,The location of the restaurant is very  much out of the way and in a not so desirable location either but sometimes this is where you get the best food. Walking into the place the staff was very friendly and helpful. I have high expectations of German food from a place i use to frequent back home and this was lacking in a few areas. As the dining room was kind of unwelcoming with the way it was setup with glass cases of countless items on display for sale. I feel like if im paying $30 a plate for dinner that i would like to eat in a dining room at the least instead i felt like i was sitting in a pawn shop. Lets get to the food split pea soup was tasty bread dumplings were just ok lacking in flavor a bit the schnitzel was good no doubt and the spaetzle was just ok. The entire mean was kind of ho hum and nothing to really write home about although i would have gone back except for what happen when i received my bill. 
German,I did what Restaurants.Com suggests in trying sides and higher priced dishes because you have your gift certificate. This is where the extra split pea soup and dumplings are ordered which i wouldnt usually do because i already know my portion is going to be huge and fill me up. Most all certificates on Restaurants.Com suggest that anywhere from a 15-20% gratuity is auto added to your bill and i personally am not a fan of this as i should be able to tip my server based on performance and is partially why i even got the Cafe Heidelburg certificate in the first place. So a bill for dinner for two came out to $64 for dinner and two sides and that was AFTER the use of my $25 gift certificate. This was partially because the waitress decided she was going to add 20% for herself regardless if my certificate disclosed that or not. That means that im almost at $90 total bill ($64 + $25= $89) to eat in a pawn shop and have mediocre food at best. I will not return as this is ridiculous there are far too many great restaurants where i can have dinner for two for $90 and you feel like it was worth it. $28 dinners for this place? If your even in Seaside CA go to Stammtisch and enjoy your dinner service and atmosphere and spend half that. http://www.yelp.com/biz/stammtisch-restaurant-seaside
German,Cafe Heidelberg where do I start? The food was very good. I have lived in Germany for a long time and I can say that the food was very authentic. We had a triple course menu with German potato soup (VERY GOOD) schnitzel baked with ham and Swiss cheese and dessert ( I ordered the Schwarzwaelder Kirchtorte = Black forest cherry cake and my husband had the Apfelstrudel with Vanilla sauce). The entree came with a side of potato salad and spaetzle. Thinking about the warm potato salad makes my mouth water:)
German,Service was good. She over spilled my husband's beer... He almost cried lol Beers were imported and brought back some memories. All in all I think this place is a little too pricey. Ok. the portions are big but honestly I would rather have smaller portions and pay less for it. I still have my restaurant.com coupon that I couldn't use that day because they only work on the normal entrees and not the special menu. Might go back not sure yet...
German,Had lunch after the real lunch hours were over and owner still made us German potato pancakes. I thought she was very nice and food was very good and authentic. Im sure the dinner would be great.
German,I love German food and always have trouble finding affordable and authentic German fare.  Cafe Heidelberg's menu covers a wide range of food and styles and is also affordable for those other reviewers complaining about the entree prices I will tell you that as someone who visits many German restaurants an entree cost of $15-$30 is MORE than reasonable.
German,If you are interested in checking out this place I would suggest going to Restaurants.com and catch a gift certificate when they are running specials.
German,Our usual dining group went to the cafe this week. We ordered a variety of dishes and ate family style. My favorites were the rolled cabbage and the dumplings. The red cabbage and sauerkraut were good but the potatoes and spatzel were just okay. The wiener schnitzel was over cooked and dry. The desserts were excellent.
German,I've been here dozens of times and this restaurant is one of those where I'll keep returning if only for the schnitzel on a bun.
German,Granted their spaetzle is bland on its own.. all noodles are.. so I like to confound the staff by ordering a size of spaetzle with saurbraten sauce.. so yummy!  I do love the saurbraten meal but I realized it's the sauce that I love about it mostly.
German,Their warm potato salad and red cabbage side dishes are always on my order love them both.
German,But back to my schnitzel on a bun.. they only have it on their lunch menu but you can order it any time you want.  As a refugee from Iowa I grew up on pork tenderloin sandwiches.. this is as close to the Iowa experience as I've found.  You eat it like a burger and choose your toppings accordingly.  My only complaint is the mustard... as a German restaurant they only have the brown mustard as an option.  But mustard aside it's something that I have to have periodically and only Cafe Heidelberg can fix this craving.
German,Oh and my German husband?  Yes he LOVES this restaurant and absolutely everything on their menu.  :-)
German,Our monthly dining group picked Cafe Heidelberg for dinner before one of our events.  It was my first time ever trying German food although I've seen plenty on Food Network and Travel Channel.
German,There was 5 of us and we decided on sharing 4 entrees the Farmer's Plate The Schnitzel combo Rinderrouladen and Cabbage rolls all about $28+ each kinda steep I know...
German,Out of the 4 entrees my favorite was the cabbage rolls it was moist and flavorful.  The other dishes were just okay.  The deep fried pork was slightly dry.  I think my favorite thing about the meal was the red cabbage.  Their sauerkraut was good too but the red cabbage was delicious!
German,For desert we got two apples strudels and the chocolate cherry cake.  The strudels were good but that chocolate cake was AWESOME not too sweet.
German,Overall food was good but would I return? Hmm not sure maybe if someone invited me =)
German,Achtung dieses Essen ist gut! 
German,Better food than the Hofbruhaus Las Vegas It has that HOME feel to it.. 
German,There was only one waitress but the place was not that busy at the time we arrived she did take care of us (table of 5) in an expedient manner and kept checking on us from time to time. 
German,It was nicely crafted food not salty or bland we shared the the Farmer's Plate The Schnitzel combo Rinderrouladen and Cabbage rolls and they were all great with that home taste although the breaded pork was slightly dry due to overcooking I still ate it....I usually hate cabbage but here was excellent I would go back and eat just that because its that good the red cabbage was superb. 
German,I wont give you a review on each dish because I forgot what was called what.... but I do remember that their pasta was not interesting at all. everything else was great. 
German,The place was clean as expected the restaurant sits in an older building and it shows but overall I liked the quaint little hole in the wall place it sits in request a booth because it seats in a more private area than on the front the front tables feel like sitting at an old cafe/ truck stop type place. 
German,For the experienced and inexperienced palate this place will bring you home great service and great food...a bit pricey but worth it. Don't forget to try their many German Beers they have a good selection.
German,Meh...not really sure what the hype was. It was decent food with large portions but nowhere near worth the $100 our bill came to after two beers and two entrees. We both ordered Franziskaner's and I had the classic schnitzel (I can't remember what my husband had). 
German,Everything about this place was average except for maybe that it's one of the few truly German restaurants in Vegas. The beer selection was great but I would hope it would be. The red cabbage was yummy and the potatoes had potential but I don't like onions so I can't really be impartial there.
German,I don't think I would eat here again...
German,Cute little place! We came here with a restaurant.com coupon. The service was extremely friendly helpful and attentive. We ordered to entrees and split a strudel for dessert. The entrees were a bit pricey but the portions were huge. The decor was awesome and really made the atmosphere fun. My favorite part was the store attached to the restaurant (which also sells the wonderful strudel). I will be back for that strudel.
German,My wife is not really sure what the hype was but I love this place. It has more than decent food with large portions but nowhere near worth the $100 our bill came to after two beers and two entrees (which is why I knock off that last star).
German,We both ordered Franziskaner's and my wife had the classic schnitzel while I have an interesting dish of which the name I cannot remember. It was some sort of meat stuffed with something. It was good I wish I didn't sound like an idiot describing it. 
German,The first time I came without the wife I had the farmer's plate and it was EXCELLENT but there was so much food I couldn't even finish it all.
German,Everything about this place is great. Everything is authentic and made from scratch and I've had the same waitress both times I've come and she is just great. 
German,The atmosphere is great too but make sure you go passed the deli and into the actually restaurant area (when you enter the store/deli go left and then right around the corner) because otherwise you'll miss out on the experience. The beer selection was great but I would hope it would be. And all of the food is excellent.
German,I will come here again whenever I get a chance. Too bad it's not a little closer to home (we're in the Northwest).
German,Either way definitely go here but beware the prices. They will stack up if you aren't careful.
Taiwanese,pretty good but too much smokers in there. the business owner is a good friend of ours. good place recommended. i haven't been there for a while but the food i remember is really good.
Taiwanese,I only like one drink here but it's enough for me to come in occasionally.  I love their green milk tea other than that I am not a fan of the drinks here.  The fruit drinks aren't made of real fruits and sometimes they taste powdery.
Taiwanese,As for the food there is only 2 things I like.  The taiwanese sausage ( I don't know where else to get this in Vegas) and the spiced pork chop plate is a pretty good price for lunch.
Taiwanese,I don't like going at night though because that's when all the young teenagers come out...and I hate the smokers too.  I wish lung cancer on all of them.  :oP
Taiwanese,Well because of the smoking law...no smoking here. Tea Planet is a great place to get different flavors of Boba from Milk tea hot fruit etc. There's a wide selection of different teas. The other cool thing is there's a bunch of tables where people can just hang out and socialize play cards read etc.
Taiwanese,They also serve food but I've never really eaten much here. My favorite is the Almond Tea. They also have really good ube tea(purple yam). 
Taiwanese,I would like to come here more often but the parking really sucks especially late at night due to Ichiza traffic.
Taiwanese,I'm surprise about the rating about Tea Planet....it should be more stars....cos to me...is really good...they have a good selection of drinks...I pick different drinks all the time...and is always good...I love their thick toast...and their food is great...I've been to a lot of these Taiwanese boba places..in NYC and SF but this one is my favorite...=)
Taiwanese,"The only thing I like here is the main thing they serve the boba teas.  I like almost all of them.  Not a big fan of the thai tea here though.  The food is below average.  I wouldn't get any unless you were really hungry and couldn't wait to eat some asian food even though there's PLENTY of other places right next door to it to eat better food.  There are a lot of younger people who go there.  Hey at least no smoking though which is a plus for me.  If you're bored ask for a deck of cards which is what everyone else seems to do.  Also it's cheaper to order a boba ""To Go.""  Maybe it's because there's limited seating so they want you to get the hell out of there?"
Taiwanese,Our out-of-town guest was in dire need of some boba before she returned back to Wisconsin.  Seeing Tea Planet all the time after my many jaunts to Ichiza it was my first time in.  This place is always popping in the late evenings and it's no exception on a weekday night.
Taiwanese,We grabbed a table by the window and perused the menu.  It took us all awhile to order since we didn't know where to start.  After getting our orders in we were able to get a deck of cards so we can be part of the crowd.  The BF and I shared a large Mango Snow Ice ($6.25) with no tapioca.  Good stuff mostly because it tasted like mango puree.  Our other friends order the Chrysanthemum tea which came with two tea cups a medium Lychee Snow Ice with tapioca ($4.75) and a Iced Black Tea.  When ordering the black tea the waiter asked if he wanted it hot or cold and he opted for cold.  He didn't expect it to be sweetened though.  It ended up being okay in the end but took him by surprise when he tasted the sweetness.
Taiwanese,To grub on we ordered Fried Spicy Chicken ($4.50) which is deep fried with basil.  The BF and I like to grub on this from various boba places that offer it.  We also tried the Fried Tofu ($4.50) which is pretty basic and comes with hot sauce.  But decent when you want fried junk.  We tried ordering the Taiwanese Pork Pacman ($6.50) but the waiter strongly discouraged us from ordering it.  We ended up with the Fried Squid Balls ($4.50) which is exactly what it is squid balls!  (Not those kind of balls duh!)  Food is pretty pricey when you look it over but you're really here for their beverages.  They also serve random things like Chicken Alfredo Pasta ($7.50) and Squid Jerky ($4.50). 
Taiwanese,The cool thing about this place is that you can chill and hang out.  You can grab a deck of cards and just have a good time.  (Apparently we were having too much fun though 'cuz they told us to quiet down.)  You'll find people of all ethnic backgrounds here as well which I always think is a cool thing.
Taiwanese,Service is just okay.  They never cleared our table so we had to put the plates on the shelf next to us.  We were there for a good couple of hours too and ordered throughout our stay so that's probably why they allowed our loud selves to stick around.  
Taiwanese,Overall I do like places that allow you to hang out and play cards.  Serving some cool beverages and good snack foods to share always makes it a decent place to kick it!
Taiwanese,Sidenote: $3 minimum per person.
Taiwanese,(I added pics of our drinking and snacking in the business profile!)
Taiwanese,"It's an okay place if you're under aged and can't get in to the clubs.  It's just your small ""coffee place"" look but serves boba-tea.  I like the fact that you can sit down and be served.  While waiting you can play cards and board games since they provide it.  "
Taiwanese,I've taken people here on a first date just to feel them out.  It's casual and not intense.  I can be myself here and just be comfortable.  My favorite drink here is the Lychee Boba Tea with Lychee chunks.  As for the food it's just okay.  Nothing special but if you're hungry they serve.
Taiwanese,"This is Las Vegas' version of Tea Station I guess.  The sign said ""Tea Planet"" but everything inside had the Tea Station logo."
Taiwanese,I think it's in the Tea Station employee hand book that the servers are supposed to be rude.  We got the same crappy service in Vegas that we would normally get in the San Diego and Los Angeles locations.
Taiwanese,Our drinks took a long time to come out (the place was not packed).   We ordered green tea green milk tea and peppermint milk tea - they were good though they tasted the same and the boba had the same consistency as the other locations.    
Taiwanese,Their spicy chicken wings were pretty good I would have to say better than the San Diego locations.
Taiwanese,This location gets 2 stars because of the bad customer service and the lengthy time it took us to get our drinks.
Taiwanese,The selection is amazing and it's perfect for a late night outing. Lots bring games to play with friends while they're there.
Taiwanese,I'm the only remaining member of my family that regularly goes to Tapioca Tea Rooms even though I was introduced to them by my kids when they were teen-agers. The best Boba Joint back then was Tea Planet as the place known as Tea Station is now called. 
Taiwanese,What makes a good Tapioca Tea Room? A wide selection of Teas with or without the Tapioca Balls. A good selection of snacks... and the Tea Station provides an ample selection of snacks to outright meals. And an ambiance that is not aimed at the teen-age crowd - the decor will tell you when you walk into Tea Station that you don't have to be a teen-ager to frequent this establishment. In fact you don't even have to order Tapioca Teas. There is bench seating against the right wall as you enter that runs the entire length of the establishment... with handsome teak tables and chairs that further define seating spaces. Very classy and nice atmosphere.
Taiwanese,My favorite Tea with Tapioca is either the Green Milk Tea or the Green Milk Tea with Honey... both with Tapioca balls.
Taiwanese,My favorite snacks are...
Taiwanese,   Tea Boiled Egg
Taiwanese,   Chinese Sausages
Taiwanese,   Fried Tofu
Taiwanese,   Bean Cake
Taiwanese,   Braised Pork with Preserved Vegetables
Taiwanese,   Instant Ramen with 1 Egg
Taiwanese,   Picked Ground Pork with Rice
Taiwanese,Why doesn't my kids like Boba anymore? They're in their mid-20s now and they've graduated (with their friends) to finer eating establishments. The main reason they give is that the crowd at the Tea Station is mainly non-Asian now... to them it has been taken over by a different crowd.
Taiwanese,After five years of not having a Tapioca Tea from the Tea Station... it seems to me it has definitely changed. I ordered a Green Milk Tea with Tapioca from there right after dinner at Ichiza upstairs from the Tea Station. The wait-staff seems a little older and a little less friendly. Of course they could have been mad that there were only two persons waiting on a 70% filled establishment - In the past there could be up to four persons waiting on customers. There is also a rule at all the Tea Stations that a person can't sit at any of the tables without ordering a snack or meal... ridiculous! The crowd is getting a little older also... the age of the crowd on a weekday at 11pm seemed to be more in their late 30s than the predominantly teen-age college-age crowd back when I lived in Las Vegas. But the ethnicity of the people there at that time of night contradicted what my kids said about the declining Asian audience... over 70% of the people there at 11pm were Asian.
Taiwanese,One thing hasn't changed though - the Tea is as good as ever.
Taiwanese,They were open on Thanksgiving.  Four stars off the bat.  Then again the Chinese places are the only ones open on Thanksgiving anyway.
Taiwanese,This is a sister store to TenRen so you know it can't be one of those awful places where the boba tastes old and crusty...  Mmm.
Taiwanese,"I just got a Tea Planet card after my first trip 4 days ago and we've already gotten 7 punched holes in our card!  Crazy!!  But seriously..love the boba.  I am not into the fried food so much but most menu items aren't bad.  Their ""pacman"" pork is prob my fav."
Taiwanese,the milk tea is made from scratch. (oolong tea and condensed milk) vs your normal made from powder crap you get at your local tap x or quicklys. the boba is fresh nice and chewy. 
Taiwanese,the mango snow ice is also very good. nice at tangy. made from fresh fruit of course!
Taiwanese,the spiced fried chicken (is not spicy) its pretty good its seasoned well and has a nice crunch nice small size and cheap snack.
Taiwanese,the pork chop fried rice was pretty good. i think the one place i like better than here is sinbala in so cal but its pretty good here. 
Taiwanese,portion size is pretty good. you get rice with ground pork on top a big piece of deep fried pork chop (seasoned well) pickled cabbage egg and this other cabbage type thing. nice and filling. 
Taiwanese,i also had the green dumplings very cute presentation of green and white skinned dumplings they taste the same (whether its green or white).
Taiwanese,the hot teas are brought to you in a clear glass tea kettle on a tray. all the other boba drinks come to you in huge glass glasses (think like those beer glasses w/ handle if you get the large size).
Taiwanese,service was good the girls working there are cute and nice. 
Taiwanese,our drinks and dishes came out pretty quickly too. 
Taiwanese,decor: i'd have to say its one of the nicest looking tea places i've been to probably can accomodate around 50 people pretty clean and plays fobby chinese music. 
Taiwanese,if you're jonesin for some boba in vegas you MUST come here. 
Taiwanese,location is pretty fair its not too far from the strip its pretty close to wynn and TI.
Taiwanese,Places like this remind me of how much i miss San Jose and places like Tapioca Express. 
Taiwanese,Ordered a Peach Yogurt snow with pears. larges are...LARGE but expensive San Jose i can expect to spend about 4.50 for one that's just a quarter smaller but here it's 6 bucks. 
Taiwanese,Other then being a penny pinching bastard i can find anything else wrong with the place will try to come back to try the mango everyone's raving about as well as the chicken.
Taiwanese,This place is MUCH BETTER then that other Taiwanese place down the road that everyone employees and customers included give me the judging eyes for a foreigner. Note i was born in CALIFORNIA and spent an enlistment in the Marines i also practice my 2nd amendment right by owning a Springfield 40cal so if I am to be considered a foreigner we got serious issues....
Taiwanese,:: UPDATE ::
Taiwanese,Okay just bumped this place up from a 3 star to a 4 star.
Taiwanese,+ Finally found something i liked that made me go up a star and that's the Iced Bubble Coffee with pearl
Taiwanese,- Everyone raves about the mango snow ice i believe to me it's not bad but i'd never order it again it tastes too artificial and lots of it.
Taiwanese,Maybe this place just isn't my cup of tea?
Taiwanese,Honestly I'm not much of tea drinker and the food on this menu was well out of my comfort zone but I was looking to try new things.  Squid jerky was definetly a new thing to try.
Taiwanese,It's been awhile since I'd eaten seafood so the taste of the squid in my mouth took some getting used to...as well that it was jerky so I couldn't eat it quickly or swallow...the taste had to linger in my mouth for quite awhile.
Taiwanese,This business is located just underneath the popular Ichiza sushi restaurant our first choice for this evening but with an hour wait we chose to go to Tea Planet instead.  The smells were excellent when we walked in though I can't quite say what it was; it was quite sweet.  Many young adults or older kids were sitting around playing card games and drinking tea or consuming some type of rice-based food.  
Taiwanese,The menu is primarily tea in many forms from hot to cold mixed and plain.  The food is almost an afterthought yet what you get when you order something from the menu is a complete meal.  I ordered the squid jerky as an appetizer (or not heh) for $4.00 my Spiced Pork Slices were $7.00 and came with sticky rice onions and greens.  It was an interesting meal that I cannot say I totally enjoyed but did not hate either.
Taiwanese,The tea was way too sweet but I could drink it.  My friends drink seemed a lot more enticing with boba and plum in her tea.  Next time I may want to try one of those instead.  The prices on the menu are all quite reasonable.  I would go here again maybe if Ichiza had a long wait but at least I can say I tried something new.
Taiwanese,Totally cute place with so-so service. I always get my boba tea to go so I don't really take advantage of the cuteness of the establishment.
Taiwanese,And when I say cute... it's cute in that Starbucks of boba kinda way.
Taiwanese,I think this is a chain.
Taiwanese,I want to say that I've seen one of these in New York.
Taiwanese,But... whatever.
Taiwanese,The lychee crushed ice drink was delish.
Taiwanese,I had the medium and it was actually pretty big.
Taiwanese,I'd drop in here again after a visit to Ichiza maybe.
Taiwanese,But I wouldn't make a special trip to come here.
Taiwanese,The quality of food and drinks at Tea Stations all over has always been consistent among each other. It's pricier than your average boba chain but you get what you paid for.
Taiwanese,JONASAPPROVED!
Taiwanese,Really slow service but great boba the food is okay.
Taiwanese,I love Tea Station...who doesn't like a cheap rice dish and a tasty refreshing drink to wash it all down. Grew up hanging out at Tea Station with friends back in So.Cal when I moved here I still come here once in a while by me self....when I crave the taste of minced pork rice with pickled veggies and a large cold honey green tea to cool off in this hot desert heat. I also like the selection of small snack/appetizer dishes....which doesn't break your wallet.
Taiwanese,This is actually the only good boba place here so far (unless anyone has any suggestions)! I like their milk green tea and maybe the mango snow ice (although it could be very sweet!). The prices are higher than most places but it's ok for a better quality of drinks...
Taiwanese,I've heard that their popcorn chicken is good...
Taiwanese,They also have lunch specials before 2pm where you can get a FREE green milk tea green tea milk tea etc. with your meal!
Taiwanese,6 years ago we did the American FOB thang and flew to Las Vegas to see the Taiwanese and Hong Kong R&B sensation version of J-Lo at the shitty Mandalay Bay Events Center (at ticket prices that would make U2 The Cure and Radiohead blush) I suppose you can call her C-Lee or stage name Coco Lee (real name ahem....Ferren Lee gotta love Hong Kongers who try to get too creative with English names). 
Taiwanese,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coco_Lee
Taiwanese,(the pic in the link is old btw you can probably find some more recent material on youtube if you want an idea).
Taiwanese,Coco is 100% Chinese speaks fluent English having spent much time in the US since age 10 (attended UC Irvine at some point) yet somehow through vocal training can belt out (in her prime which has sadly past) a voice that almost sounds like Mo Town and somehow managed to develop some serious badonkadonk that looked like it came straight outta Puerto Rico. 
Taiwanese,So we sat down for the whole show and Coco had to work on the crowd most of whom were older A$Ns and younger AZNs who came from more conservative families and didn't seem to have a clue as to how to behave at pop concerts and needed cues from the pop $en$ation herself that she needed more encouragement from the audience via louder screams or some AZN announcer trying to work the crowd again at the end of the first set for an encore (when the reverse is true at western rock concerts the audience automatically goes buck wild for encores without cues). At some point we were a bit worn out and jaded at this pseudo imported A$N pop concert experience and how lame it turned out to be (where half of the songs had no live band backing and one song was lip sync'd to the studio album playing in the background sorry Coco ain't Janet Jackson who in her prime sang AND danced) and immediately thought about where we could unwind from the madness (or lack thereof).
Taiwanese,So Tea Planet came into play. We knew about this place as TP (not toilet paper) is actually Tsing Shong Xiao Dzan aka Tea Station Cafe. It is also owned by the same group or family who operates a chain of them across Southern California (and two locations in Nor Cal Fremont and Newark) with them mainly stationed by the location by San Gabriel Square on Valley. (SGV).
Taiwanese,We had no set of wheels of our own so we cabbed it here within less than 10 minutes. 
Taiwanese,Don't remember too much about this place except the menu mirrors the Tea Stations in Southern California but not quite the same quality and vibe. My iced mixed fruit tea was overly sweetened (was my favorite drink at the Southern Cal TS). I suppose this location is better than the one in Nor Cal Newark decent and passable and for sure way better than Quickbux or some other tapioca tea joint. Then again I'm a bit biased as I'm a fan of Ten Ren straight outta Taiwan.
Taiwanese,In the words of a friend TAIWAN ROCs! (Republic of China lolz).
Taiwanese,"And Coco's a$$ got really big when we saw her again at the Shoreline in Mountain View CA  September 07 (actually we were there for opener Alex To former druggie who at 40 going towards 50 still kicked a shitload of ass like a stripper working overtime for that dollar). F******K still the same schtick from her about ""I'm so nervous I need some encouragement"" ""are y'all cuh-rayzee AZN muckafuthas ready to par-tay? Lemme hear ya scuh-reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeem b*tches!"""
Taiwanese,At least Tea Planet and Ten Ren are much less predictable than a Co Co show. $ave your money and get some OG Tea $tation sippage.
Taiwanese,Happiness is...Holding a luscious Tea Planet beverage in your hand!  I was craving a Green Tea smoothie so I headed down to Tea Planet to get my fix...I love this place!
Taiwanese,There's so many tasty beverages to choose from it's hard to decide so I guess I'll have to keep going back and experimenting these delicious concoctions!
Taiwanese,It seems like the perfect place to bring your lap-top and just chill out while getting your Boba on.  The food is pretty darn good too.  Check it out you'll be glad you did!
Taiwanese,Good tapioca drinks well it's the main thing they sell.
Taiwanese,A big plus was the food it's pretty tasty for a boba place.
Taiwanese,Before 2pm you get a free green milk tea green tea milk tea etc. with your meal that's an excellent deal.
Taiwanese,I spent the better part of my high school life here. This place is phenomenal. I have incredible memories here and have loved it forever. This place is open until 2am in the morning serves the best boba in the city (I will ONLY order taro boba here -- no one else gets it right) and never cares how loud or how much fun you are having. The food is exactly what you expect it to be made to snack on at midnight though there are a few other good entree dishes. They will give you a discount for takeout. Favorite place in the world. Would not have it any other way.
Taiwanese,I love tea and I love boba! This place is the best because they have a large selection of hot tea iced tea milk tea...et al and curiously random japanese dinners appetizers and desserts. 
Taiwanese,Free Wi-Fi is a plus and it's opened until 1 am or 2 am. I come here when I am feeling very adventurous and asian - there's nothing like drinking a sweet fruity tea concoction while chewing at the same time.
Taiwanese,This place is ok prolly the best i think in Vegas i was reading other reviews and yea Cali does have better and cheaper places for the same amount or price.  
Taiwanese,This place is usually hella busy and Ichiza is right upstairs so going on the weekends or during hours where people just got off work is not the best time to go.  Tonight was busy its not the weekend and it was around 10 but i take into consideration that there is no school for most students.  Service is lacking because its too much for two people to handle and theres big groups and no one ever leaves cause they are busy talking or playing cards.  Hey if theres no parking you can park in handicap cause no one ever checks.  And sorry to anyone physically disabled if i stole their parking space.
Taiwanese,I love this place. 
Taiwanese,My girls and I are always here.  Taro balls snow white snow ice and tea-flavored spiced pork chop are my favorites.
Taiwanese,Tea Planet - OMG! The only real Tea place in Las Vegas!!!! I frequent here often. Even the food is pretty good here. I like the pork knuckle here. My bf likes the tea flavored chicken and this place is known for their pork chop. I also like to get taiwan ice here. The tea is good; they use TEN RENS. Not all the dishes come with minced pork so you may want to ask for it if that's what you are used to. If you don't see what you like on the menu ask them. They can make it for you!
Taiwanese,Whenever I crave authentic taiwanese/HK food I come to tea station. We had some friends who were visiting from HK for awhile and we came here 5 days in a row. My favorite dish is the tea minced pork and my favorite drink is the mango yogurt. My bf gets this drink with red bean and a scoop with ice cream on top which is delicious but with a million calories. All the appetizers are fried though. It's a good place to chill play cards get a drink and hang out. Totally HK.
Taiwanese,Absolutely the worst service I've ever gotten. Unfriendly unattentive & made us felt like we are the most unwelcomed customer ever! But I do have to say their food & drinks wasn't too bad and I might just order togos instead of dining-in so I can still enjoy my bubble teas while in Vegas.
Taiwanese,"This review is base on my first visit to this place. It said Tea Planet here but i dont know why there drink and menu said "" Tea Station ""  weired !"
Taiwanese,I was craving for some milk tea while i was in Vegas so I decided to try to find a milk tea place over China Town. This is the first place that draw my attention while i was looking for the bubble place.
Taiwanese,I order a green milk tea which is good  I like how they mix the tea and the milk ratio. The tea favourite is strong. Price is a bit on the pricey side compare to bay area. 
Taiwanese,This place is clean and server is nice enough. Would come back again if i visit Vegas again. Might be i will try some of there food next time.
Taiwanese,To go drinks got 15%off
Taiwanese,:)
Taiwanese,The tea and snack-like appetizers are amazing. I've been here many times and never had a complaint on the food.
Taiwanese,The service *ussually* isn't all that great. However it generally doesn't take away from the experience.
Taiwanese,This is a great place to meet up with a friend grab some tea and bullshit about your day.
Taiwanese,Try the squid balls!
Taiwanese,This is my 1st time while in Vegas that I am off the strip.  While my brother got off of work we stopped by this center so he can grab a bite to eat.  I saw Tea Station and went in to grab a milk tea. Tea Station has an extensive menu with a lot of snacks rice bowls hot teas and milk/boba teas.
Taiwanese,The milk tea was great lots of tea flavor with just the right amount of milk and sugar.  However dont expect too much service as with many of these Asian joints but heck I sure dont mind when the milk tea is that good.
Taiwanese,I'll preface this review by saying that I spent a month in Asia recently and was absolutely spoiled by authentic Taiwanese and Chinese food. I also live close enough to LA to drive up whenever I crave good old Asian food. So those who gave this place 4 stars don't hold my rating against me just because I am spoiled. 
Chinese,I really like both Chinese restaurants in town.  This one has outstanding crab rangoon.  Love the chicken with snow peas and mushrooms and General Tso Chicken.  Food is always ready in 10 minutes which is accurate.  Good place and they give you free pop.
Chinese,Above average takeout with friendly staff. The sauce on the pan fried noodle is tasty. Dumplings are quite good.
Chinese,We order from Chang Jiang often and have never been disappointed.  The menu is huge and can accomodate anyone's taste buds.  The service is quick usually ready in 10 minutes.
Chinese,Good enough for carry-out in McFarland on a cold winter's evening.  Ready on time never had a wrong order and they're at least reasonably friendly.  Would be better if they delivered but not sure there's a huge demand for it in our tiny burg.  They also have a lunch buffet on weekdays for around $6.
Chinese,Best Chinese food madison! I've tried them all and make the 15 minute drive every week :-)
Chinese,Awful awful awful...  The worst of the worst of the cookie-cutter Chinese restaurants.  Food without flavor a menu without imagination and a staff of such profound indifference it's hard to tell they're even there.
Chinese,Tried this because it's local.  Terrible bland Chinese food.  Not much else to say.  Will never return.  My wife wanted me to mention her sweet and sour chicken which was battered fried chicken pieces with a side of sauce in a bowl.  When she asked where the vegetables were (like the picture) she was told there is a piece of pineapple in the sauce and that is what comes with it.  As promised we looked hard into the sauce and found one very small piece of pineapple.  Bon Appetite.
Chinese,Main Moon is hand's down my favorite place to grab Chinese in McFarland but really anywhere. No matter what time of day day of the week or week of the year - it only takes 15 minutes to get your food. Freshly made each time too. Don't order from the pictures order from you heart. The staff is so friendly I'm thinking about proposing in the near future as I hope to be a part of their family like they've been a part of mine. I just can't even talk about the lunch buffet I'll start tearing up with how amazing the deal is. Andddd I just shed a tear. Yum yum yum in my tum tum tum. Miss you Main Moon xoxox
Chinese,Main Moon has the best lunch in McFarland buffet style. Friendly service gloriously large takeout menus and sauces like no one else. Try their fried pork dumplings crab Rangoon or General Tso's. Their fried rice is legit. All portions are generous. Until secondary Moons are established make your lunar landing as soon as you can. Delicious.
Chinese,Leaps and bounds better than other chinese food in the Madison area. Their lunch buffet is a great value. The general tsao's is to die for.
Chinese,Don't miss out on this fantastic food.
Chinese,The china wok buffet is the best Chinese buffet I've ever been too! I only give it a 4 instead of a 5 because if i find something better(very unlikely) i won't be able to rate it as such. This buffet has everything you could want from Chinese food. It has a delicious array of chicken's pork and seafood. My personal fav's are the Tso's peppered chicken crab cheese bake deep fried shrimp and the baked salmon. Their crab Rangoon egg rolls and soup are fair. Finally their desert. Unlike most Chinese buffets I've been to this one buckets of ice cream. You serve yourself but you get a decent assortment of Mint Chocolate chip strawberry butter pecan and birthday cake. If your ever in the mood to over indulge on food at a really good price. I definitely recommend going here.
Chinese,I typically hate and do not recommend Chinese buffets but this is totally the exception. I have been going to this buffet for a few years now and it is great every time.  They don't overstock the buffet so they keep the items fresh all the time.  From the soups to apps to the main dishes is very good food.  Remember its Chinese so stay away from the sushi its not up to par with the rest of the buffet.  Finally there is ice cream kind of hidden in the back.   Put a scoop or two on top of a hot doughunt or two and you will finish in heaven.
Chinese,I went to this place at 7pm. And most of the food was cold or warm some hot fresh food. That was good but not for 10.75.  The only thing was great was the ice cram.
Chinese,Went there on Saturday night to get some food to go. On of the worst Chinese Buffets I've seen. Half of the trays were empty and other half were almost empty. Very little selection. The worst pay is the take out prices: $10.50 to get a to go box(should be under 2lb) and 40 cents for every ounce after WTF is that!!! So we just went somewhere else that night and didn't dine there at all. Bottom line: EAT SOMEWHERE ELSE.
Chinese,Not good not BAD this place is a fine choice if you're looking for totally mediocre but plentiful food. That being said I would not recommend the place to friends.
Chinese,this place is great for what it is.  i've never been disappointed - even after the lunch rush is over the food is kept fresh and rotated.  i can't speak for dinner but lunch is as good as chinese buffets get in the madison/middleton locale.  jade garden is good if they are busy but they let the food go to pot when they slow down a little.
Chinese,I live close by and stop in periodically and have not had any issues with food or service.  I have left full and happy every time.  
Chinese,Hot food...all the sushi you can eat!
Chinese,Keep up the good work!
Chinese,This place is average. Lots of food. Speedy staff. It's a casual buffet. Great for business lunches
Chinese,Some of the food on the buffet is quite good. The Szechwan pork and barbecue pork stand out in my recollection. The fried rice is memorable for its blandness and frozen peas and carrots. Cabbage was apparently the only ingredient that they could find to stuff their egg rolls with.
Chinese,This gets lows ratings for staff and service. We were barely acknowledged upon entrance and completely ignored when attempting to pay. One drink refill arrived at all and even then it was about 7 minutes later than desired. The manager chatted quite loudly on his phone while we and several others tried to settle our bills. He grunted in lieu of speaking and made his best effort to lob the receipts over the counter to avoid ever being within 6 inches of his customers.
Chinese,Not sure why I keep deciding to come back here. Rice is rock hard and has no flavor along with most of the other food on the half-empty buffet trays. $10.50 for a plate of stale food and a drink that they forget to refill? No thanks.
Chinese,Eclectic (but down-to-earth) Upbeat Friendly Inexpensive Near-healthy (see menu) Kid-friendly Fast Clean Variety.
Chinese,What more could one ask for?
Chinese,Okay sorry guys..but I was NOT impressed. Just happened to be in the neighborhood...so I decided to go to Chin's because I could sit outside. I ordered the lettuce wraps and the fried rice. The meat in the wraps was sub-standard and reminded me of dog food. The sauce was pretty much the only good part. The fried rice was described to have veggies and shrimp and crab...when it came out it was so obviously KRAB. Ugh. I won't be wasting my money again.
Chinese,"Chin's is my go-to ""fast food"" stop in my neighborhood. I fell in love with Chin's when I was living across the street from their downtown location."
Chinese,I usually go with a selection from the kid's menu the Smiling Lotus Plate. A battered chicken breast with your choice of sauce (lemon sweet & sour and teriyaki - though I'm sure you can pick any sauce these are just the kid-friendly flavors) choice of rice (white or brown) two cream cheese puffs a chocolate-coated fortune cookie and soda or milk all for $4.17 including tax.
Chinese,The SLP is by far the best deal around for my thrifty needs. The adult entrees cost twice as much and though they offer more meat they do not include any of the other goodies. One chicken breast is plenty for me. 
Chinese,Despite being inexpensive the chicken is fairly good quality - I've never had any gross bits (like the weird slimy string you find in chicken tenders at a lot of places). Occasionally the rice is on the dry side but that's why man invented sauce.
Chinese,Though 9 times out of 10 I opt for the Smiling Lotus Plate (with lemon sauce & white rice if you're wondering) occasionally I'll get the Sesame Chicken. Lots of chicken plenty of rice two meals easy.
Chinese,I'm confused why anyone would choose to go here.  
Chinese,To be clear my expectations were that it would be an all Asian version of Noodles & Co.  Cheap decent fresh food.  
Chinese,Cheap - yep
Chinese,Decent - no
Chinese,Fresh - maybe at one point
Chinese,I ordered the Thai curry noodles.  Not impressed.  I've never tasted something that claimed to be curry with so little flavor.  My vegetables were obviously charred and they still sent me the dish.  Yuck.  My boyfriend ordered the teriyaki udon and the noodles were too skinny to be udon with the same flavor issues.  Not even the chili garlic sauce did much to it.  
Chinese,Chin's - good concept but a waste of money even at $6.
Chinese,"Ashley V said it best ""why would anyone choose to go here?"" I am still traveling and the indignities of the Midwest continue. I didn't think it was cheap. I knew I was not going to get real Chinese food I knew I was coming in to get a pseudo version of Americanized Chinese food. My first indication that I was not in Peking was the Hispanic girl struggling to understand my English ordering and the POS system which was also in English. Damn oppressive society."
Chinese,Anyway I really should not disparage global initiative the restaurant is embracing. We are all going to be working for Indian companies as Obama went specifically to India to procure 15 million jobs to alleviate the unemployment crisis in this country. I welcome TATA motors and their cardboard framed cars. I digress.....
Chinese,Rosa or whatever her name was with the help of her friend Miguel (probably not his name and he was clearly only working there because it was too cold for his primary profession that being a jockey) managed to screw up my order twice overcharged me twice and never apologized. Almost thought I was in Los Angeles again.
Chinese,"The cream cheese puffs were soggy greasy and about as far from ""puffy"" as one could get. The chicken was white but it was also fatty and grisly."
Chinese,"The Thai spring rolls were not bad flavor but they too were greasy and not very crispy. The fried rice was disgusting just a greasy mush of dirty looking rice mushrooms and egg. Finally the pot stickers ah the pot stickers they should have stuck to the pot. The filling was some processed mash of something while the outside was supposed to have been lightly pan fried let's emphasize the word ""lightly."""
Chinese,This is not very good Asian food. I would suggest that there must be a better choice in Madison. I am sure there are Asians in Madison. I have not seen them but somewhere in this land must lay a pocket of Asians. There is a university with a math and an engineering department . There has to be Asians somewhere I would suggest to find them and ask them where to eat. I am sure Chin's would not be on their list.
Chinese,For what it is a fast food Americanized Oriental restaurant it's not overly bad as long as you don't order shrimp.
Chinese,Service: I've never had a problem here. While not always the most outgoing service they are friendly. My order is always ready in a decent amount of time. I've never dined in so I won't comment on atmosphere.
Chinese,Their menu and nutritional info is easily accessed on line. 
Chinese,For the most part I've had OK experiences with the food selections. I don't expect spectacular food from this place it is after all 'Fast Food' from a restaurant chain. It's nothing really special. 
Chinese,However today I had an experience that sort of turned my stomach a bit. I ordered a Shrimp and Veggie Stir fry to go. When I got back to work and went to dig in I was a little disgusted to find that the shrimp were not deveined prior to cooking. For those of you who don't know what that means: The Shrimp's digestive track (seen as a dark brown 'vein' along the spine of the shrimp) wasn't removed which means that the digestive track and it's contents were left in place. Yes I know it's not horrible to eat it but if you know what it is it can turn your stomach. I assumed that a restaurant such as this would devein shrimp prior to cooking. 
Chinese,I pulled all the shrimp and deveined them myself but I'd already lost my appetite. I did put the shrimp aside and ate some of the brown rice and veggies but with my stomach already feeling a bit nauseous that didn't go well. So now I'm left with an $8 meal sitting on my desk (soon to hit the garbage) with only about 1/8th of it consumed and having to find an alternative for lunch. 
Chinese,Lesson learned if I'm craving a good stir fry with shrimp shell out the extra cash for PF Changs.
Chinese,**** I thought eventually I'd go back but I haven't been since then. We had some of their food catered in for work it was overcooked rubbery and chewy. yeah next time I'll get my own lunch.
Chinese,I've definitely had better. The overall quality of all the food....veggies and chicken was definitely poor. I ate it but will definitely not go there again!
Chinese,My husband and I went out here on our date night. Walking through the door we instantly thought Noodles and Co. due to the menu layout on the wall. It being our first time here we made it through the typical awkward stage of processing the scene to figure out how to order and the drink situation.(they have a soda fountain that is hard to see to the left)   My husband was very satisfied with the place but I'm still a little reserved. I got the stirfry which was okay. I think the crunchy vegetables were the best. The stir fry sauce was a little bland for my liking. As usual my husband shared with me a piece of his sesame chicken and I instantly got jealous. I wanted his plate. LOL For two people w drinks two appetizers (2 spring rolls 3 cream cheese puffs) plus each upgrading to 10 ingredient fried rice $1.75 it to $27 and change. We had a living social coupon for $20 my husband still wants to come back but if I do I'm ordering off the classic menu as he did. Live and learn I guess. :) A plus they have an outside patio.
Chinese,After going to the Chin's on State St. I was pretty sure I'd never go to Chin's again. But this location is close to my work and a coworker invited me. Perhaps I am also weak?
Chinese,Anyway I was pleasantly surprised to find that for whatever reason the food here seemed much better. It could maybe be argued that the noodles are a little heavy on the sauce but everything else seemed fine. The tofu and veggies are well prepared and chewable (not the case on State St!) and really that's all I need.
Chinese,In addition the staff is always pleasant and the food comes out quickly.
Chinese,We LOVE this place. Food is excellent service fast huge portions reasonable prices. Egg drop soup spring rolls bourbon chicken with veg fried rice--fantastic. You will not be sorry you visited. On nice evenings or lunches eat outside .
Chinese,The food was alright the service was alright the portion size was generous the prices was alright. 3 stars for a decent place to grab food if you're in a hurry but nothing special.
Chinese,I was in the area.  I was about to go to Pho Nam but decided to try Chins.  
Chinese,My first impression was that this was a lot like Noodles and company with a Chinese decor.  It felt it fell short in ambiance and flavor for me.
Chinese,I ordered the Thai Noodles.
Chinese,Thai Noodles: wide Asian noodles with bok choy red onions pea pods and water
Chinese,chestnuts in coconut curry with Thai seasonings garnished with lime
Chinese,red pepper and sprouts.
Chinese,I didn't feel like this had a lot of flavor.  It was barely coconut curry and actually had a flavor that was different from anything I have ever had before.   The vegetable were fresh and the portion was good.
Chinese,My overall experience was so so but I still ended up having a good time because I was able to witness an exchange between some people that was something like a scene out of the movie Slacker by Linklater.  It was awkward.  A true cringe moment.  Bizarre. Some people can be so cold and insensitive.  It went on for about 5 minutes and really made my stop there interesting.
Chinese,There were a lot of people here from what it looked like they were on lunch from nearby businesses.  The folks here really work their butts off.  But the food and the restaurant could be so much better.
Chinese,Much like it's former State Street counterpart this place used to be awesome. The food is still good but it's not so fast anymore and the ingredients seem to be a bit skimpy. My 10 Ingredient Fried Rice had about 4 shrimp. Lame. Still - it's all delicious. But I never used to have to wait 15 minutes and it all-around used to be shinier.
Chinese,We love Asia Fresh. bourbon chicken with veg fried rice-perfect. Take away done quickly. service great. Great price.
Chinese,We did takeout from here and both thought our dinners were awesome.  We ordered:
Chinese, - Chicken wings with Sesame Szechuan sauce (you can get them with any stir fry sauce choice)
Chinese,Then we got stuck in rush hour/post blizzard traffic and had a 40 minute commute home.  We were both impressed how well the food held up after that amount of time! The flavor of the wings was good but they were obviously no longer hot.  Next time we will try those when we dine in.   Everything else had lots of heat and flavor.  The hot and sour soup looked different than any other I have eaten but it was still good and plenty hot.  I did not detect much sour in it my only small complaint.  We both felt we had more than enough food for $23 and the quality was great.  We will definitely go back.  I am actually a little shocked at all the bad reviews on this place after our dining experience.  Not sure if they have improved things or we just hit it on a good night.  Service was fast friendly and accurate...no complaints there.
Chinese,The food here is quite good actually. Not 5 star restaurant quality but for the price and service it's decent. The staff was friendly and I didn't wait long in line. The teriyaki chicken and cream puffs are my favorites and even though the chocolate covered fortune cookie was meant for little kids I still have the balls to ask for one lol. Overall not a bad choice at all.
Chinese,Oh and I'll say it straight off the bat this place is not authentic asian food. But for what it is (which is pan asian fast food) it did not disappoint me.
Chinese,Fast food Chinese is generally not that exciting but I must say this place really was quite impressive. Very fresh tasting ingredients with a lot of good flavors all served hot and with a smile. What more could you ask for?
Chinese,A fast-casual spin-off of a Minnesota-based fast-food Chinese-American chain that likewise serves nothing special Chin's gets one star for being the only Asian-American place I know of in Dane County that serves fried cream cheese wontons without crabmeat. I require a side dish of epinephrine if I eat crab so I appreciate this omission. Now that I have established that I go here just for the cream cheese puffs it should be clear that I'm far from an expert on Asian food. So take the rest of my review with a grain of salt; there should be plenty to spare in your entree. 
Chinese,I used to think this place was ok -- it still has plenty of variety a very friendly staff good chili-garlic sauce decent potstickers above-average lettuce wraps no grisly or fatty pieces of meat -- but lately the preparation has been sloppy and the presentation just as bad. I suspect the quality of the ingredients has come down a notch. 
Chinese,"After cream cheese wontons Pad Thai is one of my favorite Asian entrees. My last order looked like Goldilocks's porridge in the ""Three Little Bears"" Golden Book I had as a kid. Dull gray soupy greasy salty and watery yet somehow sticky. The chopped peanuts added no crunch at all which is too bad because other than the chicken pieces I picked through the mess to find I was hoping to find something else edible. Epic fail on this entree. "
Chinese,On my next visit I ordered the Firecracker noodles with chicken as a side to my beloved wontons. Slight improvement from last time but still salty as the Dead Sea and enough grease to de-squeak every door hinge on the west side. The bag was so heavy I skipped my biceps workout for a week. The red peppers had no life left. Again I hunted and pecked for the chicken which is consistently decent-quality well-prepared white meat. My wife's veggie fried rice would have been ok -- they ease up on the salt and Valvoline for this entree -- but the vegetables were overcooked and charred in places. Fresh veggies should present as a bright spectrum of colors -- orange from the carrots bright green from the scallions broccoli and pea pods yellow from the corncobettes. Instead however they were the same brown color as the fried rice. 
Chinese,My last fortune cookie said I'll probably return to Chin's. It's on the way home from work the food comes out fast and I can't resist those damn cream cheese wontons. Maybe I'll throw in some potstickers or wraps and call it dinner.
Chinese,I like that I can add items to a base entree to make it my own.  I love the Thai peanut lo mein.  the noodles were easy to eat (they were cut shorter).
Chinese,We tried to order for delivery because we are 4 miles away. On their menu it says $15 minimum. We called to place the order and we were told today it's a $75 minimum. We found that insane so never ordered.
Chinese,I always get the lemon chicken and it's delicious! Nice light batter and very crispy with a good amount of sauce. The potstickers are also very good.
Chinese,Only thing less disappointing then the food is the staff.   Ordered Chin Wings Hot & Sour soup and Sesame Chicken to go.. What I get in return is Chin Wings with the wrong stir fry sauce a cup of hot & sour and lemon chicken.  They charged me for what I ordered yet they still refused a refund me or to replace my food.. Avoid this place like the plague.
Chinese,The food was decent.  But yet again the staff managed to screw my order up and ended up charging me more then what I should of payed for.
Chinese,We come here a lot and the food is never consistent. Sometimes it's really salty. Other times it's too spicy or not spicy enough. There must be several different cooks because the sauce is never the same either. We still like the adventure of what we may get today. Stop for quick bite on the way home. If you tried it and didn't like it you may want to try again you may be surprised at how much better or different the next time may be. 
Chinese,The servers here are friendly enough but some times they difficult to read. Place is not always clean but it's clean enough. I don't like the fact that some of the tables are falling apart but there is always customers here so they must be doing something right.
Chinese,Good food and prices are reasonable!
Chinese,I will never order from there again. I called to find out what was on the hot and spicy chicken. The person who answered informed me that it was both hot and spicy but it was serves with broccoli snow peas and onions. Once I got my entree it was neither hot nor spicy. On top of that there was no broccoli. Too many onions barely any snow peas AND a very small amount of chicken. Did I mention that I don't think the chicken was actually chicken? It was cut so thin and had no chicken flavor. The white rice that accompanied my dish was mushy and clumped together. I've made better rice boiling it. My mom had the Kung pao chicken and she was also dissatisfied with her meal. The crab Rangoon was ok... Fairly basic. 
Chinese,I won't return there. I would prefer to give it a ZERO
Chinese,Hubby has been eating here for years but since I only occasionally visit WI he never convinced me to give this little dive a try. Now I'm sad about what i've been missing! Cannot understand how they do it for SO cheap - amazingly fresh tasty generous Chinese. Clean open kitchen very fast and large variety. Liked it so much that I got a lunch special to go for the bus ride over to O'Hare. They packed it up tight but remember to take napkins condiments and utensils. I loved the shrimp with broccoli (also had carrots) and the shrimp were large and plentiful. Wonton soup (4 big dumplings) on a cold day was delish and included in the lunch special. Also got chicken egg foo yung which included large well filled egg roll - also tasty mustardy sauce OK (not as good as the brown sauce I'm used to). All lunch specials include roast pork fried rice which was good enough to buy on its own. Seems like a mom/pop place so support your local Chinese joint - down with PF/PW/PE.
Chinese,We go here pretty regularly. The food is good but by no means great. It is pretty divey looking (photos of food etc) and they mess up our order abt 20% of the time but still a good value for the price. General Tso's chicken is great. I asked for brown rice once and they gave us fried rice... to their credit it was brown :)
Chinese,I have ordered food from here on numerous occasions. It's always been good and reasonably priced. I wish they delivered. That is the only drawback.
Chinese,"Always good friendly and hot. My family likes this ""Chinese"" best in Sun Prairie. The food is even better of you eat it ""in"". Never full of customers (is that good?) it seems like they do a lot of take-out business. There is delivery. Not much updated decor. Good for when you want local basic Amer/Asian same menu as all the rest. Some days it's better than others but never bad."
Chinese,I ate there 2 times. I recommend sea food soup spicy salty shrimp Singapore rice noodle. The location is not that good. It's in Sun Prairie a suburb area from Madison WI. I believe if the location is in downtown Madison it would be one of the top Chinese restaurant in Madison.
Chinese,Panda Garden is the best place to get Chinese food in Sun Prairie. And they deliver which is a plus in my book! I've eaten in the restaurant a couple of times but usually do take out. I've never had anything I didn't like there (and we've tried a very good array of items). Tonight we had the Garlic Shrimp and Chicken Lo Mein. Both were awesome! The Garlic Shrimp had a nice spicy kick to it but still had a TON of flavor! The crab Rangoon and pot stickers are also tasty!  Pricing is very reasonable for what you get!
Chinese,I love this place. The fried dumplings are to die for.
Chinese,Easy on-line menu great selection and fabulous food. 
Chinese,I ordered hot/ sour soup egg roll and chicken/ broccoli. All of it was great. I can't wait to go back.
Chinese,Every time my boyfriend and I eat here it has been great. We really enjoy the steamed dumplings and hot and sour soup. The staff is very friendly too.
Chinese,I was unhappy due to having to wait 55 minutes for my one meal (steamed veggies combo with chicken shrimp and scallops!  Then I get two pieces of shrimp three small slices of chicken a few tiny scallops!!  For $12.00 that is a rip off a joke and unacceptable!  You going to charge for food with those items in you better put more than sliced veggies!!  I will never come back!
Chinese,This is take out only.  They have at least two locations that I am aware of.  One in Sun Prairie and one in Fitchburg.  They have excellent Chinese food and the prices are pretty good.
Chinese,Best chinese I've found so far. Hot and sour soup and their won ton soup are fantastic. Sometimes I'll go and just get the soup.
Chinese,I haven't had better Crab Rangoon than they serve here.  The people who work there are pretty nice too.
Chinese,The general tso's and boneless spare ribs are about as good as you'll find. No lie!
Chinese,Meh. It's okay when you want something quick. Not overly impressed. Fried rice is good.
Chinese,Pretty bland for Chinese take out.
Chinese,We used to go here for our Americanized Chinese food every so often for the last 7 years.  However in the last year the quality of their food has taken a nose dive to unacceptable levels of blech and blah.
Chinese,The rice and steamed vegetables were good but that's about all we could tolerate. We ordered General Tso's which is what we always get when we first try a Chinese restaurant. It helps us compare to other places.The quality of the chicken used was awful. The dumplings were flavorless. We will not be returning.
Chinese,Blech.  My brother heard this was the best Chinese buffet in Sun Prairie.  Maybe that is true but it must be the only Chinese buffet in Sun Prairie.
Chinese,"I'm not giving it a hard time for ""authenticity"" or any of that eaither.  I love me some good Americanized crappy Chinese food.  Here even the stuff that was out fresh from the kitchen (which was mighty slim picken's) was barely edible."
Chinese,I was really looking forward to some good old MIdwestern Chinese buffet too.  The Chinese food options in Portland are actually very lacking the last really good stuff I had was from a strip mall in Crawfordsville IN.  Seriously they can do it right but everyone else serves lukewarm tasteless piles of mystery?  Gotta be kidding me.
Chinese,"Most options seemed to have been sitting for way too long when we got here and it was peak dinner eating time.  I should have been tipped off by the low number of patrons at this ""best Chinese"" but I like to give the benefit of the doubt."
Chinese,You are better off making Ramen noodles at home and calling it chinese food.
Chinese,This place is both a buffet and a takeout restaurant. For take out it's great. As a buffet it's okay. The food is always fresh and the buffet is refreshed constantly so nothing sits out very long. It's nothing fancy but it's good. Not great. But good. It's a favorite for take out while living out in the boonies!
Chinese,I love this place.  The food is always fresh they keep an eye on the buffet so they can refill the trays quickly.  I've never had anything here that wasn't great.
Chinese,UPDATE:  This place closed down about a year ago.  Sadness. Another mom and pop Chinese buffet goes by the wayside of stretching themselves too thin.
Chinese,I resisted going here for the past several years that I've lived in Sun Prairie b/c of all the other mediocre Chinese food buffet restaurants I've eaten at that left me a bit disappointed.
Chinese,Their selection is less in numbers of dishes than other places around the Dane County area; however in terms of quality and freshness it's rather good. Since other reviewers did not go into significant detail about the offerings I'll mention my first time experience recently on a Sunday (where there were about three other tables of diners):
Chinese,- chicken skewers (these were excellent even though I didn't expect them to be based on appearance)
Chinese,I like the emphasis on quality rather than quantity. And this place was clean.  It's tucked away in a strip mall by Walmart so points against it for location.  But you can't beat the price $7-8 for a buffet meal!  Of course afterwards I had to nap off the food coma ...
Chinese,I have been eating here for at least 7 years and it's excellent.  Typically a group of us go there for lunch coming from work.   I love the pepper chicken the broccoli and the chicken on a stick things.  Ohh yes the peanut butter chicken is also excellent.  My 4 kids really love going there too when we happen to be in that area on a weekend.  They've been going there every now and then since they were babies.    
Chinese,I have heard that they may not be able to renew their lease as that part of the strip mall may be changed.  That would be very disappointing.  They have been a loyal staple spot for years while stores with in the mall have changed some of which are still vacant.   If you have not checked them out give them a try.  If you enjoy them go back for a visit incase they are soon gone.
Chinese,closed.
Chinese,This restaurant was forced to close due to a greedy landlord that suddenly doubled their rent probably because of the upgrades done with the new Walmart.  Does anyone know where this family went or if they opened in another location?  I would gladly go to the the one.  I haven't found any Chinese food as good.
Chinese,I enjoy this place everytime I go in there. Its family owned and has consistently good food. Large soda selection with  awesome crab rangoon. My favorite dish is the Happy family which has beef pork chicken crab and veggies in brown sauce.
Chinese,Way too sweet for my liking. Real authentic Chinese food isn't always sweet. In my opinion if you like sweet taste this much might as well eat candy bar dip in corn syrup as a meal. When I ordered my food a few years back from them they put too much food coloring so much that it looked yellow. It was not appealing to me. But it has been years I haven't been there so they could have improved and better. I sure hope that's the case.
Chinese,As far as take-out places go in Madison this is my favorite. Consistently tasty fair prices large portions and friendly employees. 
Chinese,I am eating microwaved general tso's chicken from last night and it is still awesome. 
Chinese,Excellent steamed dumplings and egg rolls.
Chinese,The fried dumplings rock!
Chinese,One liner for quick reads:  Fresh made Hot and Sour soup!
Chinese,Yes...they make the Hot and Sour Soup when you order it...no gelatinous nasty leftovers here.  
Chinese,Service can be a little slow but definitely worth it.  Good overall food. Our favorite Chinese takeout.  (note...we always pick up so I cannot comment on the delivery)
Chinese,It was delicious but expensive for delivery. I had the cashew chicken (no veggies so they gave me extra meat - thumbs up!) crab rangoon and a 2-L of soda. Very friendly staff.
Chinese,We go here religiously whenever we are craving Chinese take-out (which happens a lot!) I could imagine this place is overlooked but it seriously has some of the best food in town. Service is fast and the food comes out consistently great every time. Order the pork fried rice you won't regret it.
Chinese,Singapore dish was perfect!! And they even had my favorite nestea pomegranate & passion fruit .. Huge portions also!
Chinese,Good stuff!  Had the sesame chicken general tsa pot stickers and crab Rangoon.  All were great and were ready quickly.
Chinese,Pretty good for takeout. The meat is more sound than usual Chinese take out
Chinese,My daughter and I stopped in last night for the first time.  I had the Chicken Chop Suey and she had Sweet & Sour Chicken.  We started with an order of Steamed Dumplings.  The dumplings were great.  They had a lot of meat in them.  The Chop Suey was made with a white sauce.  I am used to it being made with a brown sauce.  That did not matter as it was delicious.  The S&S Chicken was wonderful as well.  The S&S sauce that came with it was not laden with all that bright red food coloring.  Very tasty.   She also got an Egg Roll.  It was huge!  We had to split it.  Niiice.  And even though you order and pick your food up at a counter the service was great.  I ordered a Chicken Lo Main to go for my son and she asked me if I wanted them to wait a bit before they cooked it.  I like that!  That tells me that they care about our experience after I pay them!!  A plus!  We've passed this place up numerous times.  Not any more.  We'll be back!
Chinese,Still good but I tried the Chicken Fried Rice.  Don't bother.  The chicken was tasteless.  All they did was steam it.  The seasoning was all in the rice.  Disappointing.  I thought fried rice was an industry standard.
Chinese,My husband and I came in Saturday night to dine in. (Can't say that's a very popular option but I was starving)
