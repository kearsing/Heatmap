Bad Boys(Bay),"Miami detectives Marcus Burnett (Martin Lawrence) and Mike Lowrey (Will Smith) investigate $100 million of seized Mafia heroin which was stolen from a secure police vault. Internal Affairs suspects that it was an inside job and threatens to shut down the entire department unless they recover the drugs within five days.
Lowrey asks one of his informants and ex-girlfriend Maxine ""Max"" Logan (Karen Alexander) to look for people who are newly rich and therefore suspects. She gets herself and her best friend Julie Mott (Téa Leoni) hired as escorts by Eddie Dominguez (Emmanuel Xuereb) a former crooked cop. The party is interrupted by Dominguez's French drug kingpin boss Fouchet (Tchéky Karyo) and his henchmen Casper Ferguson and Noah. Dominguez and Max are killed while Julie manages to escape.
At the police station Julie insists on talking only to Lowrey who is away. Knowing she never met Lowrey captain Conrad Howard (Joe Pantoliano) forces Burnett to impersonate Lowrey to talk to her. At her apartment Burnett and Julie are attacked by one of Fouchet's henchmen whom Burnett kills. When they rendezvous with Lowrey Burnett and Lowrey have to impersonate each other and they keep it up in Julie's presence.
Looking through mugshots Julie identifies Noah as one of the henchmen. The trio go to Club Hell one of Noah's known hangouts. After being spotted Burnett knocks Casper unconscious during a bathroom fight. Julie tries to kill Fouchet but Burnett stops her. In the ensuing car chase Lowrey kills Noah. The three manage to get away but are caught on camera by a news helicopter and later seen by Burnett's family.

The Rock(Bay),"A group of rogue U.S. Force Recon Marines led by disenchanted Brigadier General Frank Hummel and his second-in-command Major Tom Baxter storm a heavily guarded naval weapons depot and steal a stockpile of deadly VX gas–armed M55 rockets. The next day Hummel and his men along with Marine Captains Frye and Darrow seize control of Alcatraz Island taking eighty-one tourists hostage. He threatens to launch the rockets against San Francisco unless the U.S. government pays him $100 million from a military slush fund which he will distribute to his men and the families of Recon Marines who died on clandestine missions under his command but whose deaths were not compensated.
The Pentagon and FBI develop a plan to retake the island with a U.S. Navy SEAL team led by Commander Anderson enlisting the FBI's top chemical weapons specialist Dr. Stanley Goodspeed. FBI Director James Womack is forced to offer a pardon to federal prisoner John Mason in return for information. Mason a 60-year-old British national imprisoned without charges for three decades is the only Alcatraz inmate to ever escape the island. After being setup in a hotel Mason escapes resulting in a car chase with Goodspeed through the streets of San Francisco. While seeking out his estranged daughter Jade Goodspeed arrives but covers for Mason by telling Jade that he is aiding the FBI.
Goodspeed Mason and the SEALs infiltrate Alcatraz but Hummel's men are alerted to their presence and ambush them in a shower room. All the SEALs are killed leaving only Mason and Goodspeed alive. Mason sees his chance to escape custody and disarms Goodspeed but is convinced to help Goodspeed defuse the rockets after the Marines use explosive devices to flush them out.
They eliminate several teams of Marines and disable 12 of the 15 rockets by removing their guidance chips. Hummel threatens to execute a hostage if they do not surrender and return the guidance chips; instead Mason destroys the chips and surrenders to Hummel to try and reason with him as well as buy Goodspeed some time. Though Goodspeed disables another rocket the Marines capture him. With the incursion team lost the military initiates their backup plan: an airstrike by F/A-18s with thermite plasma which will neutralize the poison gas but kill everyone on the island.
Mason and Goodspeed escape and Mason explains why he was held prisoner: he was a British SAS Captain who stole a microfilm containing details of the United States' most closely guarded secrets refusing to give it up when captured because he knew he would be killed if he did. When the deadline for the transfer of the ransom passes Hummel fires one of the rockets but then redirects it to detonate at sea. He reveals to the Marines that the mission is over and that it was all an elaborate bluff as he never had any intention of taking innocent lives. Hummel orders them to exit Alcatraz with a few hostages and the remaining rocket to cover their retreat while he assumes blame. Frye and Darrow rebel upon realizing they will not be paid their $1 million apiece killing Baxter and mortally wounding Hummel who tells Goodspeed where the last rocket is before dying.
Darrow and Frye proceed with the plan to fire on San Francisco. Goodspeed seeks out the rocket while Mason deals with the remaining Marines. As the jets approach Goodspeed disables the rocket before killing both Frye and Darrow. He signals that the threat is over just as one jet drops a bomb; though no hostages are injured Goodspeed is thrown into the sea by the blast and Mason rescues him.
Goodspeed and Mason part ways after Mason reveals the location of the microfilm; Goodspeed fakes Mason's death by telling Womack that he was killed in the bomb explosion. Sometime later Goodspeed and his newlywed wife Carla are seen stealing the microfilm from a church and driving away."
Armageddon(Bay),"A massive meteor shower destroys the orbiting Space Shuttle Atlantis and bombards a swath of land around the North Atlantic. NASA discovers through the Hubble Space Telescope that the meteors were debris propelled from the asteroid belt by a rogue asteroid roughly the size of Texas christened ""Dottie"" by its discoverer. The asteroid will collide with Earth in 18 days causing a second extinction event. NASA scientists led by Dan Truman plan to trigger a thermonuclear detonation at least 800 ft (244 m) inside the asteroid to split it in two driving the pieces apart so both will fly past the Earth. NASA contacts Harry Stamper considered the best deep-sea oil driller in the world for assistance. Harry insists he will need his full team to help execute NASA's plan and they agree to help but only after their list of unusual rewards are met.
NASA plans to launch two specialized Space Shuttle orbiters the X-71s Freedom and Independence to increase the chances of success; the shuttles will refill with liquid oxygen from the 11-year-old Russian space station Mir (which is modified to have artificial gravity by rotating on itself) before making a slingshot maneuver around the Moon to approach the asteroid from behind. NASA puts Harry and his crew through a short and rigorous astronaut training program while Harry's team re-outfit the mobile drillers ""Armadillos"" for the job. During training Truman and Harry are skeptical about the abilities of A.J. Frost a hot-headed drill operator who has been dating Harry's daughter Grace against Harry's wishes.
The destruction of Shanghai by a meteorite forces the government to reveal the asteroid's existence as well as their plan. The shuttles are launched and arrive at the space station where its sole cosmonaut Lev Andropov helps with refueling. A major fire breaks out during the fueling process forcing the crews including Lev to evacuate in the shuttles before the station explodes. The shuttles perform the slingshot around the Moon but approaching the asteroid the Independence's engines are destroyed by trailing debris and it crash-lands on the asteroid. Grace aware A.J. was aboard the Independence is traumatized by this news believing he was killed. Unknown to the others A.J. Lev and ""Bear"" (another of Harry's crew) survive the impact and head towards the Freedom target site in their Armadillo.
Freedom safely lands on the asteroid but overshoots the target zone landing on a much harder metallic field than planned and their drilling quickly falls behind schedule. The military initiates a backup plan they call ""secondary protocol"" planning to remotely detonate the weapon at the asteroid's surface despite Truman and Harry's insistence that it would be ineffective. Truman delays the military while Harry convinces the shuttle commander Colonel Willie Sharp to disarm the remote trigger. Harry's crew continues to work but in their haste they accidentally hit a gas pocket blowing their Armadillo into space and losing another man. As the world learns of the mission's apparent failure another meteorite decimates most of Paris.
All seems lost until Independence's Armadillo arrives. With A.J. at the controls they reach the required depth for the bomb. However flying debris from the asteroid damages the triggering device requiring someone to stay behind to manually detonate the bomb. The crew draw straws and A.J. is selected. As he and Harry exit the airlock Harry rips off A.J.'s air hose and shoves him back inside telling him that he is the son Harry never had and gives his blessing to marry Grace. Harry contacts Grace to bid his final farewell. After some last minute difficulties involving both the shuttle engines and the detonator the Freedom moves to a safe distance and Harry triggers the detonation while his life flashes before his eyes. The bomb successfully splits the asteroid avoiding the collision with Earth. Freedom safely returns to Earth and the surviving crew is treated as heroes. A.J. and Grace get married with photos of Harry and the other lost crew members present."

Lincoln begins having dreams that he knows are not from his own experiences. Dr. Merrick a scientist who runs the compound is concerned and places probes in Lincoln's body to monitor his cerebral activity. While secretly visiting an off-limits power facility in the basement where his friend technician James McCord works Lincoln discovers a live moth in a ventilation shaft leading him to deduce the outside world is not really contaminated.

Transformers(Bay),"Several thousand years ago the planet Cybertron was consumed by a civil war between the two Transformer factions the Autobots led by Optimus Prime and the Decepticons led by Megatron. Optimus jettisoned the AllSpark a mystical artifact that brings life to the planet into space but Megatron pursued it. Megatron crashed in the Arctic Circle and froze and was discovered in 1895 by explorer Archibald Witwicky. Witwicky inadvertently activated Megatron’s navigational system which etched the AllSpark’s coordinates into his glasses. The glasses end up in the possession of his great-great-grandson Sam Witwicky. In the present Sam buys his first car a rusting Chevrolet Camaro but discovers it has a life of its own.
In modern Qatar Blackout attacks and destroys a United States military base in a failed attempt to hack the military network to find information on Megatron and the AllSpark. A team of Army Rangers led by Captain William Lennox escape across the desert pursued by Blackout’s drone Scorponok. They fight Scorponok off aided by aerial reinforcements and travel home with Scorponok’s stinger discovering sabot rounds damaged its armor. At the Pentagon Secretary of Defense John Keller leads the investigation into the attack. Sound analyst Maggie Madsen catches another Decepticon Frenzy hacking into the U.S. military network while onboard Air Force One. While the hack is thwarted Frenzy downloads files on Archibald’s glasses tracking down Sam with Barricade disguised as a police car.
Sam and his high school crush Mikaela Banes are rescued from Barricade and Frenzy by the Camaro who turns out to be Autobot scout Bumblebee but he is mute and has to communicate through his car radio. Previously sending a beacon to his fellow Autobots Bumblebee takes Sam and Mikaela to meet the new arrivals – Optimus Jazz Ironhide and Ratchet.

One of them later known as The Fallen defies their sole rule to never destroy planets hosting life by establishing a Sun Harvester on Earth. He is confronted by the other Primes who imprison him before he can harvest the planet's Sun using the Matrix of Leadership. The Primes then sacrifice themselves to hide the Matrix in an unknown location.
In the present day two years after Megatron's defeat the Autobots and the U.S. military have formed the Non-biological Extraterrestrial Species Treaty (NEST) a classified international task force to eliminate the surviving Decepticons. In Shanghai the Autobots intercept two Decepticons Demolisher and Sideways. Sideways is killed by the Autobot Sideswipe while Optimus Prime kills Demolisher but not before he warns them of the Fallen's return. At NEST's secure headquarters in Diego Garcia National Security Adviser Theodore Galloway concludes the Decepticons are still on Earth to hunt the Autobots since Megatron's corpse is at the bottom of the Laurentian Abyss and the last known AllSpark shard is secured in the base. Soundwave hacks into a military satellite overhears the information and sends Ravage to retrieve the shard.
Meanwhile Sam Witwicky is preparing to attend college leaving his girlfriend Mikaela Banes and guardian Bumblebee behind. He finds a smaller AllSpark shard and picks it up causing him to start seeing Cybertronian symbols. The shard's energy pulse turns the appliances in the kitchen into murderous Transformers who attack Sam and his family. After Bumblebee destroys the rampaging appliances Sam gives the shard to Mikaela who later captures the Decepticon Wheelie when he attempts to steal it. The Constructicons upon discovering Megatron's location travel to the Laurentian Abyss and resurrect Megatron using the stolen shard and parts torn off from one of their own allies. Megatron then travels to one of Saturn's moons where he reunites with his master the Fallen who orders him to capture Sam alive and kill Optimus the only Transformer who can defeat the Fallen.
Sam Mikaela and his college roommate Leo are attacked by Alice a Decepticon Pretender posing as a college student. After killing her they are captured by Megatron Starscream and the Decepticon Grindor but Optimus and Bumblebee arrive and rescue the humans.

After killing Grindor Optimus is killed by Megatron. The other Autobots arrive and repel Megatron and Starscream before they could recapture Sam. As Sam goes into hiding with Mikaela Leo Bumblebee Wheelie and the Autobot twins Skids and Mudflap the Decepticons launch devastating simultaneous attacks around the world destroying ships in the Second Fleet and damaging Paris. The Fallen hijacks Earth's telecommunications systems demanding that Sam be handed to him.
Sam Mikaela and Leo enlist the help of former Sector Seven agent Seymour Simmons who reveals that the Transformers visited Earth eons ago and the most ancient known as Seekers remained on Earth hiding in secret. With help from Wheelie they track down a Decepticon Seeker named Jetfire at the Smithsonian Air and Space Museum. They use their shard to revive Jetfire who teleports the group to Egypt and explains the story of the Fallen. Jetfire and Wheelie turn against the Decepticons and order them to locate the Matrix which could revive Optimus. Sam's group finds the Matrix in Petra but it disintegrates into dust in Sam's hands. Undeterred Sam stuffs the Matrix's remains into his sock.
Meanwhile NEST forces and the Autobots land near the Giza pyramid complex but are attacked by a large force of Decepticons. During the battle many Constructicons combine to form Devastator who destroys one of the pyramids to reveal the Sun Harvester inside before he is killed by a destroyer's railgun called in by Simmons. Ravage and the Decepticon Rampage attempt to spring a trap with Sam's captured parents as bait in order to force Sam to give them the Matrix but Bumblebee interferes and kills them both. Major William Lennox and Master Sergeant Robert Epps call in an airstrike which kills a majority of the Decepticon ground forces. However Megatron manages to shoot Sam seemingly killing him before retreating upon getting attacked. Nearing his death the Primes contact Sam through a vision telling him the Matrix is earned not found and that he earned the right to bear it. They restore Sam's life and the Matrix which he uses to revive Optimus.
The Fallen teleports to their location and steals the Matrix from Optimus then returns to the pyramid with Megatron and activates the Sun Harvester. Jetfire who was gravely wounded during the battle by Scorponok but did manage to kill his attacker sacrifices himself in order to transplant his parts to Optimus which give him immense strength and the ability to fly. Optimus knocks the Fallen and Megatron off the pyramid destroying the Sun Harvester in the process. In the battle Optimus disables Megatron and kills the Fallen; vowing vengeance Megatron retreats with Starscream. The victorious Autobots and their allies then return to the United States at the aircraft carrier."

They locate two surviving Russian cosmonauts who reveal satellite photos of hundreds of Pillars being stockpiled on the Moon. Sam realizes that the Decepticons raided the ""Ark"" long before the Apollo 11 mission to the moon and intentionally left Sentinel and the five Pillars for the Autobots to find as Sentinel is the key to activating the Pillars and the Decepticons lacked the means to revive him. The Autobots rush to return Sentinel to their base for protection but Sentinel betrays them and murders the Autobot Ironhide revealing he had made a deal with Megatron to ensure Cybertron's survival.
Sentinel uses the Pillars to transport hundreds of concealed Decepticons from the Moon to Earth. Carly is later captured by Gould who is revealed to be in service of the Decepticons. The Autobots are exiled from Earth at the demand of the Decepticons to avoid war but as their ship leaves Earth it is destroyed by Megatron's second-in-command Starscream seemingly killing the Autobots. The Decepticons led by Megatron and Sentinel invade Chicago as their agents place Pillars around the world. Gould reveals to Carly that the Decepticons plan to transport their homeworld of Cybertron to the Solar System then to enslave humanity and use Earth's resources to rebuild their world. Sam teams up with former USAF Chief Robert Epps and ex-NEST soldiers to go into Chicago to save Carly but they are nearly killed by Decepticon forces before the Autobots intervene revealing they concealed themselves during the launch of their ship to convince the Decepticons they were destroyed.
Working together the Autobots along with several ex-Rangers and Navy SEALs manage to rescue Carly and kill Laserbeak Starscream Soundwave and Shockwave with Optimus using Shockwave's arm-cannon to blast the Control Pillar disabling the Space Bridge. Sam confronts Gould as he reactivates the Control Pillar and knocks Gould into the Pillar killing him.

Pain & Gain(Bay),"In 1995 schemer Daniel Lugo (Mark Wahlberg) is a recently released convict who had served time for Medicare fraud. Sun Gym owner John Mese (Rob Corddry) hires him to increase membership and make the gym more fitness-based. Lugo increases the gym's membership by 75% within six weeks and befriends trainer Adrian Doorbal (Anthony Mackie) a bodybuilder rendered impotent due to his steroid use. Lugo soon lusts after the earnings and lifestyle achieved by Victor Kershaw (Tony Shalhoub) a sleazy new member he begins to train who Lugo believes is a crook. Inspired by motivational speaker Jonny Wu (Ken Jeong) Lugo decides to be a ""do-er"" and hatches a plan to extort Kershaw for his assets by kidnapping and torturing him.
Lugo recruits accomplices Doorbal and Paul Doyle (Dwayne Johnson) a recently released cocaine-addicted convict who has turned to Christianity. Though Doyle is reluctant to join the team he soon acquiesces after a being kicked out of the halfway house he is living in after the priest running the home makes a sexual pass at him.

The scheme goes as planned otherwise: Kershaw makes calls under duress to provide false explanations for his disappearance gets his family to move out of state and signs the documents that transfer his assets to Lugo. Lugo even bribes John Mese to notarize documents in Kershaw's absence by presenting documents signed by Kershaw and using Kershaw's money to sponsor the Sun Gym.
The Sun Gym gang is able to collect Kershaw's money and assets but they realize releasing him is a bad idea. Therefore Lugo concocts a plan to kill Kershaw by forcing him to drink liquor and crash his BMW making it appear like a drunk driving accident. When Kershaw survives the crash the gang burns the car with Kershaw in it. Kershaw escapes the blazing vehicle so the gang runs over his body twice and leave him for dead. Unbeknownst to them Kershaw survives and is hospitalized. The Sun Gym gang members spoil themselves with Kershaw's riches. Lugo takes over Kershaw's car and his home in a ritzy Miami suburb; Doorbal marries the nurse who has been treating his impotence Robin (Rebel Wilson) and uses his cut to purchase penile erection treatments; and Doyle abandons his restraints of religion and sobriety and blows away his money on cocaine and his new stripper girlfriend.
Kershaw reports what happened to the police but they are turned off by his unpleasant manner and do not believe his bizarre story even when he gives them Daniel Lugo's name particularly because of Kershaw's blood alcohol level and the fact that Kershaw was born in a South American country well known for its involvement in the drug trade. He then contacts Ed Du Bois III (Ed Harris) a retired private investigator - who declines to take the case but warns Kershaw to quickly leave the hospital before the gang returns to kill him. Kershaw takes his advice and hides in a cheap motel. Upon reflection Du Bois takes Kershaw's case and tails the Sun Gym gang. He visits the Sun Gym and meets with Lugo who becomes suspicious after Du Bois mentions Kershaw's name.
When Kershaw furiously calls Mese about his stolen money Lugo Doyle and Doorbal *69 the call thereby identifying where it originated and go to the motel to kill Kershaw; however they arrive too late as he has checked himself out and is hiding at an abandoned baseball stadium. When Lugo and Doorbal discover that Du Bois is paying for Kershaw's room using his own credit card they plan to kidnap Du Bois at his home. They arrive at the house but the plot is thwarted when the police stop by to drop off Du Bois. In order to evade arrest Lugo and Doorbal run and jump off Du Bois' dock into the water.
Du Bois gets a message from Kershaw and goes to the stadium to take him home. Meanwhile Doyle (who has wasted all of his share of the spoils) attempts to rob an armored car. However dye packs planted in the money bag explode and he narrowly escapes the police getting his toe shot off in the process. He and Doorbal (who depleted his share on payments for treatments his and Robin's wedding and a new home) explain to Lugo they need more money and the gang plans another kidnapping.
They target the wealthy Frank Griga ( Rispoli) who owns a phone sex operation. After a promising discussion at Griga's mansion the gang invites Griga and his wife Krisztina Furton (Keili Lefkovitz) to Doorbal's home to propose an investment scheme. Griga insists on meeting with someone more senior and questions Lugo's amateurish business savvy. This angers Lugo who attacks Griga and accidentally kills him. Krisztina discovers this and tries to shoot Lugo but Doorbal injects her with a potent horse tranquilizer. Lugo and Doyle try to use the combination obtained from a heavily sedated Krisztina to open a safe at her and Griga's home but the combination does not work. When Krisztina rouses and tries to escape Doorbal gives her a second injection accidentally causing her to fatally overdose.
Lugo and Doorbal purchase equipment to dismember and dispose of the bodies and dump the parts in oil drums (which they sink in a secluded swamp outside Miami) while Doyle incinerates their hands on a barbecue grill to eliminate their fingerprints. Doyle perturbed by the violence he committed leaves the gang and returns to the priest's church. The police learn of Griga and Krisztina's disappearances and with evidence from Du Bois they set a plan to arrest the Sun Gym gang.
The film returns to June 17: the police arrest Doyle at the church Doorbal at home and Mese at the Sun Gym. Lugo also at the gym spots the approaching police force and flees. Although struck by a police cruiser he escapes and heads out by sea in Kershaw's speedboat. Kershaw and Du Bois deduce Lugo is going after the former's hidden bank account in Nassau Bahamas and accompany the police to capture him. Lugo's pursuers catch up with him and he attempts to escape. Du Bois shoots Lugo Kershaw chases him in a car and incapacitates him and the authorities arrest him.
Lugo is brought back to the United States and stands trial with Doyle Doorbal and Mese. At the trial Doyle rolls over on Doorbal and Lugo with a full confession and meanwhile Robin has divorced Doorbal the night before and testifies against him. Ultimately the four are convicted.
The end credits reveal the fates of the main characters:
The movie ends with Lugo's saying: ""That's the American dream""."
Transformers: Age of Extinction(Bay),"Sixty-five million years ago an alien race known as the ""Creators"" used devices called Seeds to terraform planet Earth effectively wiping out the dinosaurs and covering it with an alloy called Transformium. In the present day geologist Darcy Tirrel excavates the Transformium for K.S.I. Industries which uses it to build man-made artificial Transformer drones.
Five years after the Battle of Chicago the humans have begun to view the Transformers as a threat to public safety leading the U.S government to terminate all human-Autobot joint programs. Although the public believes that the Autobots have been granted sanctuary they are actually being hunted by a rogue CIA black ops division known as Cemetery Wind led by opportunistic government official Harold Attinger who believes that all Transformers should be exterminated regardless of faction. They are aided by Lockdown a Cybertronian bounty hunter working for the Creators who promises to give Attinger a Seed if his division manages to capture Optimus Prime. Cemetery Wind locates Ratchet in Mexico City and Lockdown kills him when he refuses to give up Optimus' whereabouts.
Optimus damaged and disguised as a rundown semi-truck is discovered in an abandoned theater by Cade Yeager a financially struggling Texan inventor and brings him back to his farm. While his teenage daughter Tessa and business partner Lucas Flannery encourage him to turn Optimus over to the authorities after realizing what he really is Cade instead fixes Optimus hoping to understand his technology and unexpectedly revives him. Still skeptical of Optimus Lucas calls Cemetery Wind who attacks and destroys the farm but Optimus and Tessa's boyfriend Irish rally car driver Shane Dyson come to their aid. While on the run from Cemetery Wind and Lockdown Lucas is killed by one of Lockdown's grenades. The survivors flee to the desert and take shelter in an abandoned gas station. Later Optimus scans a new more functioning alternate mode then summons the surviving Autobots – Bumblebee (who now has a new alternate form) Hound Drift and Crosshairs. Using a CIA drone that he stole during the attack Cade discovers K.S.I.'s involvement in the attacks on the Autobots. Optimus vows to personally kill Attinger and make him pay for his actions against his fallen brethren.
Infiltrating K.S.I.'s headquarters in Chicago Cade discovers the remains of Autobots and Decepticons are being melted down to make the drones. Joshua Joyce the ambitious company CEO is collaborating with Attinger to revolutionize global defenses and improve human society using the Seed. He has captured the Autobot Brains and is using him and data from Megatron's head to create prototype Transformer soldiers named Galvatron and Stinger. Outraged at Cade's discovery the Autobots storm the building (in which Bumblebee gains a new alternate form along the way) rescue Brains and destroy the laboratory but they leave after Joshua declares they are no longer needed in the world. In retaliation Attinger forces Joshua to deploy Galvatron and Stinger to attack the Autobots. During the battle Galvatron starts destroying vehicles on its own will and even speaks to Optimus while fighting him. Lockdown then arrives and abducts Optimus while Galvatron and Stinger retreat; Tessa is inadvertently captured as well.
While Lockdown's large prison spacecraft hovers over Chicago to hand over the Seed Cade Shane and the Autobots use this opportunity to sneak on board and rescue Optimus and Tessa. They hijack a smaller ship containing a number of other Autobots called the Dinobots just before Lockdown leaves Earth. The Autobots reveal to Cade that Galvatron is in fact Megatron who gave K.S.I. the data to build the Transformer drones so that he could transfer his consciousness into the Galvatron drone after K.S.I. officials unknowingly revived him and is plotting to use the Seed and the K.S.I. drones to conquer the world by detonating the Seed in Hong Kong as K.S.I. has brought it there to use it in the remote Mongolian desert to create vast amounts of usable Transformium. Cade contacts Joshua to inform him of Megatron's presence causing him to have a change of heart and agreeing to hand over the Seed with help from Darcy and his Chinese business associate Su Yueming. Meanwhile Lockdown finds out about Optimus's escape with the Dinobots and returns to Earth to retrieve them.
Optimus decides the Autobots should no longer help humans since they revived Megatron but Cade convinces Optimus to not lose faith in them. Back at the facility Galvatron reactivates himself and takes control of the K.S.I. drones. A battle breaks out in Hong Kong's streets between Cade's group the Autobots Cemetery Wind Galvatron and his drones. During the fight Optimus forms an alliance with the Dinobots while Bumblebee kills Stinger. Lockdown returns to recapture Optimus and the Dinobots first by using a large magnet in his ship that picks up and drops metal objects causing destruction to the city. After disabling the magnet Optimus fights Lockdown at an abandoned factory. In the ensuing duel Optimus kills Attinger (who still believes all Transformers are a threat) to save Cade before being impaled with his own sword by Lockdown. Cade and Bumblebee fight Lockdown while Tessa and Shane use a tow truck to free Optimus who kills Lockdown before using one of his grenades to finish off the remaining drones. Now the only surviving drone Galvatron retreats vowing to return.
As Lockdown's ship leaves Earth Optimus tells the Autobots to protect the Yeagers and lets the Dinobots go. Joshua also offers to help the Yeagers build a new home. Optimus then flies away into space with the Seed to hide it away while sending a message to the Creators that he is coming for them."
13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi(Bay),"In 2012 Benghazi Libya is named one of the most dangerous places in the world and countries have pulled their diplomatic offices out of the country in fear of an attack by militants. The United States however still has a diplomatic compound (not an official consulate) open in the city. Less than a mile away is a CIA outpost called ""The Annex"" which is protected by a team of private military contractors from Global Response Staff (GRS). New to the detail is Jack Silva who arrives in Benghazi and is picked up by Tyrone ""Rone"" Woods commander of the GRS team and a personal friend of Silva. Arriving at the Annex Silva is introduced to the rest of the GRS team and the CIA Chief of Station who constantly gives the team strict reminders to never engage the citizens.
The U.S. Ambassador Chris s arrives in Benghazi to maintain diplomatic connections amidst the political and social chaos. Despite warnings s decides to stay at the Special Mission with limited protection from a pair of Diplomatic Security (DS) agents Scott Wickland and Dave Ubben and guards hired from the local February 17th Martyrs Brigade militia nicknamed ""17-Feb"". On the morning of the eleventh anniversary of the September 11 attacks s notices suspicious men taking pictures of the compound and notifies his security detail. Back at the Annex Silva finds out that his wife is pregnant.
That night a group of militants from Ansar al-Sharia assault the compound. The 17-Feb guards quickly surrender their posts allowing the attackers easy access to the Special Mission compound. Wickland takes s and Smith an IT specialist into the safe room. Unable to breach the safe room the attackers set the building on fire hoping to burn the men out. Wickland is able to escape but loses both s and Smith. At the Annex the GRS team desperately wants to go to the compound to help but the Chief refuses fearing that the team's departure would expose the Annex. However the team dispatches to the compound and meets up with the DS agents. Silva and Woods go into the building to try to find s and Smith but are only able to find Smith's body. The DS team from the compound retreats to the Annex; but after Wickland goes in the wrong direction they are followed back to the Annex. Later the GRS team also retreats to the Annex.
Knowing an attack by the militants is imminent the CIA staff of the Annex makes several desperate calls for help. The only help they can get is from Glen ""Bud"" Doherty a GRS officer in Tripoli who forms a team including two Delta operators that fly to Benghazi after several delays. Meanwhile the GRS team fends off the militants as they try to breach the Annex perimeter. After repelling the largest attack wave the Annex receives word from ISR that help is en route.
The Tripoli GRS reinforcements arrive and begin preparing the CIA and DS staff to depart for the airport. The militants launch a mortar attack in which Ubben and Geist are wounded; Geist's left arm is partially severed. Woods rushes to aid Geist and is killed by another mortar round. Doherty is also killed when a third mortar detonates directly in front of him.
With the GRS team compromised and the Annex now vulnerable the remaining GRS operators watch as a convoy of vehicles rolls toward the Annex. Fearing the worst the operators prepare to make a final stand until it is revealed that the convoy is an element of the Libya Shield Force militia escorting the GRS reinforcements. They also find out that s was found behind the compound but was pronounced dead at the hospital.
At the airport the CIA staff and the wounded Geist board the plane to Tripoli while the remainder of the GRS team waits for the next plane with the bodies of s Smith Woods and Doherty. Closing titles reveal that all of the surviving members of the Annex security team received contractor medals in a private ceremony and have since retired from the GRS team and live with their families (Geist was able to save his arm after several surgeries)."
Transformers: The Last Knight(Bay),"In 484 AD King Arthur and his knights battle against the Saxons. Elsewhere Merlin approaches the Knights of Iacon a group of Transformers hiding on Earth to help win the war. They hand him an alien staff before transforming together into Dragonstorm warning Merlin that a great evil will come for the staff.
In the present a year after the Hong Kong Uprising[N 1] Optimus Prime crash-lands on Cybertron and meets his alleged creator Quintessa. She blames Optimus for Cybertron's destruction and brainwashes him into helping to gain Merlin's staff which can absorb Earth’s energy to restore their homeworld. Earth is revealed to be the slumbering Unicron whose horns are emerging across the planet.
On Earth Transformers remain unwelcome amongst humanity apart from in Cuba and are hunted by the Transformers Reaction Force (TRF) a paramilitary force formed from the fallen Cemetery Wind. Cade Yeager an ally to the Autobots helps hide refugees from the TRF in his remote junkyard. In the war-torn Chicago Cade Bumblebee street-wise scavenger Izabella and her Transformer companions Sqweeks and Canopy help a group of children evade the TRF drones but Canopy is killed. Cade receives a mechanical talisman from a dying Autobot knight and has a brief standoff with the TRF before heading back to his junkyard with Izabella and Sqweeks. Both Megatron and the American military become aware of the talisman’s value and power reluctantly joining forces to obtain it. A group of Decepticon prisoners are released to aid in the mission.
The Decepticons and the TRF locate Cade's hideout thanks to a tracker that the TRF had planted on Bumblebee during the standoff. Cade his assistant Jimmy Izabella and Sqweeks flee from the Decepticons and the TRF to an abandoned town where the Autobots ambush their enemies and defeat them while Cade Jimmy and Izabella battle a unit of TRF drones. Cogman a steampunk Transformer approaches Cade and invites him to travel to the United Kingdom and meet his employer Sir Edmund Burton who has connections to the Transformers. Burton also has his associate Hot Rod bring Viviane Wembley a University of Oxford English Literature professor to his estate.
Bringing Cade Viviane and Bumblebee together Burton explains that Transformers have been aiding mankind in war for centuries their existence hidden by a secret society of historical figures known as the Order of Witwiccans and that he is the last living member. The talisman can lead to Merlin’s staff buried with him in a Cybertronian spacecraft hidden at the bottom of the sea. However only a direct descendant of Merlin can wield it revealing Viviane is the last in his bloodline. The TRF and the local authorities discover them forcing them to flee. Following a series of clues while evading their pursuers Cade Viviane Bumblebee and Cogman commandeer the submarine HMS Alliance which is revealed to be a Transformer to find the spacecraft followed by the TRF in their own submarines.
Burton later contacts Seymour Simmons both learning that Earth is Unicron and the staff will be used to drain the planet’s life via an access point hidden under Stonehenge. Locating the ship Cade and Viviane discover Merlin’s tomb and obtain the staff. Viviane activates it causing the spacecraft to become airborne awakening the Knights of Iacon. As the TRF try to take the staff from them Optimus arrives forcing them to surrender the staff. Bumblebee and Cade confront Optimus the former speaking in his own voice stirring Optimus' memories and freeing him from Quintessa's control. The Knights try to execute Optimus for his presumed betrayal but Cade stops them when his talisman transforms into Excalibur and the Knights yield to him. The Autobots and human military forces then converge on Stonehenge. They then engage the Decepticons and Quintessa's minions who either flee or are killed while Quintessa is seemly destroyed by Optimus and Bumblebee. The worlds are then saved upon Vivian removing the staff.
In a mid-credits scene Quintessa who has survived and is disguised as a human approaches a group of scientists inspecting one of Unicron’s horns offering a way to destroy him."
Firelight(Spielberg),Firelight follows a group of scientists — particularly Tony Karcher and UFO believer Howard Richards — as they investigate a series of colored lights in the sky and the subsequent disappearance of people animals and objects from the fictional American town of Freeport Arizona. Among those abducted are a dog a unit of soldiers and a young girl named Lisa whose abduction induces a heart attack in her mother. The film has sub-plots involving marital discord between Karcher and his wife Debbie and the obsessive quest of Richards to convince the CIA that alien life does not exist.

Duel(Spielberg),"David Mann is a middle-aged salesman driving on a business trip. He encounters a tanker truck on a two-lane highway in the Mojave Desert traveling below the speed limit and expelling sooty diesel exhaust. Mann passes the truck but the truck then roars past him. When Mann overtakes and passes it again the truck blasts its horn. Mann leaves it in the distance.
Mann pulls into a gas station and shortly afterward the truck arrives and parks next to him. Through the space beneath the truck bed he sees the driver is wearing cowboy boots. Mann phones his wife who is upset with him after an argument the previous night. The gas station attendant refills Mann's car and mentions that it needs a new radiator hose but he says he will get it fixed later.
Back on the road the truck catches up passes and blocks Mann’s path each time he attempts to pass. After antagonizing Mann for some time the driver waves him past. However when Mann attempts to pass he almost runs into an oncoming vehicle. He realizes the truck driver tried to trick him into a crash so he passes the truck using an unpaved turnout next to the highway and taunts the driver as he speeds past.
The truck tailgates Mann at high speeds forcing him to increase his speed to avoid being rear-ended. Mann finally drives his car off the road and collides with a fence opposite a diner. The truck continues down the road and Mann enters the diner to compose himself. Though he assumes the truck driver's road rage has been satisfied upon returning from the restroom he sees the truck parked outside. He studies the diner patrons and confronts a man wearing the same cowboy boots he saw on the truck driver. Offended the driver strikes Mann and drives away in a different truck. The pursuing truck leaves seconds later indicating its driver was never inside the diner.
Mann leaves the diner and stops to help a stranded school bus but his front bumper becomes caught underneath the bus's rear bumper. The truck appears at the end of a tunnel. Mann panics frees his car by jumping on the hood while the bus driver puts the car in reverse and flees. To Mann's slight chagrin the truck starts the bus by giving it a push-start to get it moving. Shortly afterward Mann is stopped at a railroad crossing when the truck pushes his car toward a passing freight train. After the train passes Mann crosses the tracks and pulls over. The truck continues down the road and Mann follows.
Mann stops at a gas station to call the police and replace his radiator hose but when he steps into the phone booth the truck drives into it. Mann jumps clear just in time However the truck also drives into some glass cages featuring wild animals where Mann barely escapes from getting bitten by a rattlesnake. The lady who runs the station cries out in horror as the truck destroys her cages and potentially kills some of the animals that lived in them. He gets into his car and speeds away. Around a corner he pulls off the road hiding behind an embankment as the truck drives past apparently without noticing him.
After a long wait Mann heads off again but is shocked to find the truck waiting for him down the road. Mann attempts to speed past but it moves across the road blocking his way. Mann seeks help from an older couple in a car but they flee when the truck backs up towards them at speed. The truck stops before hitting Mann's car and the driver waves him past. At one point Mann observes a black-and-white car parked on the side of the road. Thinking that it is a police car he skids to a stop only for him to realize that it is a pest control vehicle. He speeds off and the chase continues. The truck chases him up a mountain range. The radiator hose of Mann's car breaks causing the car to overheat. He barely makes the summit and coasts downhill in neutral as the truck bears down on him. However a sign states that trucks have to use low gear the next twelve miles and the truck driver is forced to slow down allowing Mann to gain speed.
Mann's car cools off enough to allow him to drive up a dirt road and the truck follows him. He turns to face his opponent on a hill overlooking a canyon. He places his briefcase on the accelerator and steers toward the oncoming truck jumping from the car at the last moment. The tanker hits the car which bursts into flames obscuring the truck driver's view. The driver realizes it is too late and honks one final time at Mann before the truck plunges over the cliff killing him. Above the wreckage Mann jumps up and down laughing with glee and relief. Physically and mentally exhausted and with no way to get home he sits at the cliff's edge and throws stones into the canyon as the sun sets."

Jaws(Spielberg),"During a beach party at dusk on Amity Island a young woman Chrissie Watkins goes skinny dipping in the ocean. While treading water she is violently pulled under. The next day her partial remains are found on shore. The medical examiner's ruling that the death was due to a shark attack leads police chief Martin Brody to close the beaches. Mayor Larry Vaughn overrules him fearing that the town's summer economy will be ruined. The coroner now concurs with the mayor's theory that Watkins was killed in a boating accident. Brody reluctantly accepts their conclusion until another fatal shark attack occurs shortly thereafter. A bounty is placed on the shark prompting an amateur shark-hunting frenzy. Local professional shark hunter Quint offers his services for $10000. Meanwhile consulting oceanographer Matt Hooper examines Watkins's remains and confirms her death was caused by a shark—an unusually large one.
When local fishermen catch a tiger shark the mayor proclaims the beaches safe. Hooper disputes that it is the same predator confirming this after no human remains are found inside it. Hooper and Brody find a half-sunken vessel while searching the night waters in Hooper's boat. Underwater Hooper retrieves a sizable great white shark's tooth embedded in the submerged hull. He drops it in fright after encountering a partial corpse. Vaughn discounts Brody and Hooper's claims that a huge great white shark is responsible for the deaths and refuses to close the beaches allowing only added safety precautions. On the Fourth of July weekend tourists pack the beaches. Following a juvenile prank the real shark enters a nearby estuary killing a boater and causing Brody's oldest son  to go into shock. Brody then convinces Vaughn to hire Quint.
Quint Brody and Hooper set out on Quint's boat the Orca to hunt the shark. While Brody lays down a chum line Quint waits for an opportunity to hook the shark. Without warning it appears behind the boat. Quint estimating its length at 25 feet (7.6 m) harpoons it with a line attached to a flotation barrel but the shark pulls the barrel underwater and disappears.
At nightfall the shark returns unexpectedly ramming the boat's hull and disabling the power. The men work through the night repairing the engine. In the morning Brody attempts to call the Coast Guard but Quint smashes the radio. After a long chase Quint harpoons another barrel into the shark. The line is tied to the stern cleats but the shark drags the boat backward swamping the deck and flooding the engine compartment before breaking the cleats off. Quint severs the line to prevent the transom from being pulled out. He heads toward shore to draw the shark into shallower waters but the overtaxed engine fails.
With the Orca slowly sinking the trio attempt a riskier approach. Hooper puts on scuba gear and enters the water in a shark-proof cage intending to lethally inject the shark with strychnine using a hypodermic spear. The shark demolishes the cage before Hooper can inject it but he manages to escape to the seabed. The shark then attacks the boat directly and devours Quint. Trapped on the sinking vessel Brody stuffs a pressurized scuba tank into the shark's mouth and climbing the mast shoots the tank with a rifle. The resulting explosion obliterates the shark. Hooper surfaces and he and Brody paddle to Amity Island clinging to boat wreckage."
Close Encounters of the Third Kind(Spielberg),"In the Sonoran Desert French scientist Claude Lacombe and his American interpreter cartographer David Laughlin along with other government scientific researchers discover Flight 19 a squadron of Grumman TBM Avengers that went missing more than 30 years earlier. The planes are intact and operational but there is no sign of the pilots. An old man who witnessed the event claimed ""the sun came out at night and sang to him."" They also find a lost cargo ship in the Gobi Desert named SS Cotopaxi. At an air traffic control center in Indianapolis a controller listens as two airline flights narrowly avoid a mid-air collision with an unidentified flying object (UFO) which neither pilot chooses to report even when invited to do so. In Muncie Indiana 3-year-old Barry Guiler is awakened in the night when his toys start operating on their own. Fascinated he gets out of bed and discovers something or someone (off-screen) in the kitchen. He runs outside forcing his mother Jillian to chase after him.
Investigating one of a series of large-scale power outages Indiana electrical lineman Roy Neary experiences a close encounter with a UFO when it flies over his truck and lightly burns the side of his face with its bright lights. The UFO joining a group of three other UFOs is pursued by Neary and three police cars but the spacecraft fly off into the night sky. Roy becomes fascinated by UFOs much to the dismay of his wife Ronnie. He also becomes increasingly obsessed with subliminal mental images of a mountain-like shape and begins to make models of it. Jillian also becomes obsessed with sketching a unique-looking mountain. Soon after she is terrorized in her home by a UFO which descends from the clouds. The presence of the UFO energy field makes every appliance in Jillian's house malfunction and Barry is abducted by unseen beings.
Lacombe and Laughlin—along with a group of United Nations experts—continue to investigate increasing UFO activity and strange related occurrences. Witnesses in Dharamshala India report that the UFOs make distinctive sounds: a five-tone musical phrase in a major scale. Scientists broadcast the phrase to outer space but are mystified by the response: a seemingly meaningless series of numbers (104 44 30 40 36 10) repeated over and over until Laughlin with his background in cartography recognizes it as a set of geographical coordinates which point to Devils Tower near Moorcroft Wyoming. Lacombe and the U.S. military converge on Wyoming. The United States Army evacuates the area planting false reports in the media that a train wreck has spilled a toxic nerve gas all the while preparing a secret landing zone for the UFOs and their occupants.
Meanwhile Roy's increasingly erratic behavior causes Ronnie to become upset and leave him taking their three children with her never to be seen again. When a despairing Roy inadvertently sees a television news program about the train wreck near Devils Tower he realizes the mental image of a mountain plaguing him is real. Jillian sees the same broadcast and she and Roy as well as others with similar visions and experiences travel to the site in spite of the public warnings about nerve gas.
While most of the civilians who are drawn to the site are apprehended by the Army Roy and Jillian persist and make it to the site just as dozens of UFOs appear in the night sky. The government specialists at the site begin to communicate with the UFOs by use of light and sound on a large electrical billboard controlled by a multiple-manual synthesizer. Following this an enormous mother ship lands at the site releasing animals and over a dozen long-missing adults and children all from different past eras. Among these returned abductees include the missing pilots from Flight 19 and sailors from the Cotopaxi all of whom have strangely not aged since their abductions. Barry is also returned and reunited with a relieved Jillian. The government officials decide to include Roy in a group of people whom they have selected to be potential visitors to the mothership and hastily prepare him.
As the aliens finally emerge from the mothership they select Roy to join them on their travels. As Roy enters the mothership one of the aliens pauses for a few moments with the humans. Lacombe uses Curwen hand signs that correspond to the five-note alien tonal phrase. The alien replies with the same gestures smiles and returns to its ship which ascends into space as Barry bids Roy goodbye."

Raiders of the Lost Ark(Spielberg),"In 1936 archaeologist Indiana Jones braves an ancient booby-trapped temple in Peru and retrieves a golden idol. He is confronted by rival archaeologist René Belloq and the indigenous Hovito people. Surrounded and outnumbered Jones surrenders the idol to Belloq and escapes aboard a waiting floatplane.
Jones returns to his teaching position at Marshall College where he is interviewed by two Army Intelligence agents. They inform Jones that the Nazis are searching for his old mentor Abner Ravenwood under whom Jones studied at the University of Chicago. The Nazis know that Ravenwood is the leading expert on the ancient city of Tanis in Egypt and that he possesses the headpiece of the Staff of Ra. Jones deduces that the Nazis are searching for the Ark of the Covenant — the Nazis believe that if they acquire the Ark their armies will become invincible. The Staff of Ra is the key to finding the Well of Souls a secret chamber in which the Ark is buried.
The agents authorize Jones to recover the Ark to prevent the Nazis from obtaining it. He travels to Nepal and discovers that Ravenwood has died and the headpiece is in the possession of Ravenwood's daughter Marion. Jones visits Marion at her tavern where she reveals her bitter feelings toward him from a previous romantic affair. She physically rebuffs his offer to buy the headpiece and Jones leaves. Shortly after a group of thugs arrive with their Nazi commander Arnold Toht. Toht threatens Marion to get the headpiece but Jones returns to the bar and fights the Nazis to save Marion. During the fight the bar is set ablaze and the headpiece lands in the flames. Toht severely burns his hand trying to take the hot headpiece and flees the tavern screaming. Jones and Marion escape with the headpiece and Marion decides to accompany Jones in his search for the Ark so he can repay his debt to her.
The pair travels to Cairo where they meet up with Jones' friend and skilled digger Sallah. Sallah informs them that Belloq and the Nazis are digging for the Well of Souls with a replica of the headpiece (created from the scar on Toht's hand). They quickly realize the Nazi headpiece is incomplete and that the Nazis are digging in the wrong place. The Nazis kidnap Marion and it appears to Jones that she is killed in an exploding truck. After a confrontation with Belloq in a local bar Jones and Sallah infiltrate the Nazi dig site and use their staff to correctly locate the Ark. Jones discovers Marion is alive when he finds her bound and gagged in a tent. He refuses to release her out of fear of alerting the Nazis. Jones Sallah and a small group of diggers unearth the Well of Souls and acquire the Ark. Belloq and Nazi officer Colonel Dietrich arrive and seize the Ark from Jones throwing Marion into the Well of Souls with him before sealing it back up. Jones and Marion escape to a local airstrip where Jones has a fistfight with a Nazi mechanic and destroys the flying wing that was to transport the Ark to Berlin. The panicked Nazis remove the Ark in a truck and set off for Cairo but Jones catches them and retakes it. He makes arrangements to take the Ark to London aboard a tramp steamer.
The next day a Nazi U-boat appears and intercepts the ship. Belloq and Dietrich seize the Ark and Marion but cannot locate Jones who stows away aboard the U-boat and travels with them to an island in the Aegean Sea. Once there Belloq plans to test the power of the Ark before presenting it to Hitler. Jones reveals himself and threatens to destroy the Ark with a panzerfaust but Belloq calls his bluff and Jones surrenders rather than destroy such an important historical artifact. The Nazis take Jones and Marion to an area where the Ark will be opened and tie them to a post to observe. Belloq performs a ceremonial opening of the Ark and finds it contains nothing but sand. Suddenly angelic ghost-like beings emerge from the Ark and Jones cautions Marion to keep her eyes closed and not to look no matter what happens. Belloq and the others look on in astonishment as the apparitions are suddenly revealed to be angels of death. A vortex of flame forms above the Ark and shoots bolts of fiery energy into the gathered Nazi soldiers killing them all. As Belloq Toht and Dietrich all scream in terror the Ark turns its fury on them: Dietrich's head shrivels up Toht's face is melted off his skull and Belloq's head explodes. Flames then engulf the remains of the doomed assembly save for Jones and Marion and the pillar of fire rises into the sky. The Ark's lid is blasted high into the air before dropping back down onto the Ark and sealing it. Jones and Marion find their ropes burned off and embrace.
In Washington D.C. the Army Intelligence agents inform Jones and Marcus Brody that the Ark is someplace safe and will be studied by ""top men"". The Ark is shown being stored in a giant government warehouse among countless similar crates."

Dorinda completes the dangerous task with Pete's unseen help. On the way back he tells her all the things he wanted to say but never got around to while he was alive.
Dorinda is forced to make an emergency water landing on the lake.

Jurassic Park(Spielberg),"Industrialist John Hammond and his bioengineering company InGen have created a theme park called Jurassic Park on Isla Nublar a Costa Rican island populated with cloned dinosaurs. After one of the dinosaur handlers is killed by a Velociraptor the park's investors represented by lawyer Donald Gennaro demand that experts visit the park and certify it is safe. Gennaro invites mathematician and chaos theorist Ian Malcolm while Hammond invites paleontologist Dr. Alan Grant and paleobotanist Dr. Ellie Sattler. Upon arrival the group is stunned to see a live Brachiosaurus.
At the park's visitor center the group learns that the cloning was accomplished by extracting dinosaur DNA from mosquitoes that had been preserved in amber. DNA from frogs was used to fill in gaps in the dinosaur genomes. To prevent breeding all the dinosaurs were made female. Malcolm scoffs at the idea of such controlled breeding declaring it will inevitably break down. The crew witness the birth of a baby raptor and visit the raptor enclosure. During a luncheon the group debates the ethics of cloning and the creation of the park with Dr. Malcolm giving a harsh warning about the implications of genetic engineering as a whole.
The group is then joined by Hammond's grandchildren Lex and Tim Murphy for a tour of the park while Hammond oversees the trip from the park's control room. The tour does not go as planned with most of the dinosaurs failing to appear and the group encountering a sick Triceratops. The tour is cut short as a tropical storm approaches Isla Nublar. Most of the park employees evacuate on a boat to the mainland while the visitors return to their electric tour vehicles except Sattler who stays with the park's veterinarian to study the Triceratops.
Jurassic Park's lead computer programmer Dennis Nedry has been bribed by Dodgson a man working for Hammond's corporate rival to steal valuable fertilized embryos. Nedry deactivates the park's security system to gain access to the embryo storage room where he stores the embryos inside a canister disguised as Barbasol shaving cream supplied by Dodgson. Because of Nedry the power goes out and the tour vehicles become stuck. Most of the park's electric fences are deactivated as well allowing the Tyrannosaurus to escape and attack the tour group. Grant Lex and Tim escape while the Tyrannosaurus injures Malcolm and devours Gennaro. On his way to deliver the embryos to the island's docks Nedry becomes lost in the rain crashes his Jeep Wrangler and is killed by a Dilophosaurus.
Sattler assists the park's game warden Robert Muldoon in a search for survivors but they only find an injured Malcolm before the Tyrannosaurus returns. Grant Tim and Lex take shelter in a treetop. Later they discover the broken shells of dinosaur eggs. Grant concludes that the dinosaurs have been breeding which occurred because of their frog DNA—West African bullfrogs can change their sex in a single-sex environment allowing the dinosaurs to do so as well proving Malcolm right.
Unable to decipher Nedry's code to reactivate the security system Hammond and the park's chief engineer Ray Arnold opt to reboot the entire park's system. The group shuts down the park's grid and retreats to an emergency bunker while Arnold heads to a maintenance shed to complete the rebooting process. When Arnold fails to return Sattler and Muldoon head to the shed. They discover the shutdown has deactivated the remaining fences and released the raptors. Muldoon distracts the raptors while Sattler goes to turn the power back on before being attacked by a raptor and discovering Arnold's severed arm. Meanwhile Muldoon is caught off-guard and killed by the other two raptors.
Grant Tim and Lex finally reach the visitor center. Grant heads out to look for Sattler leaving Tim and Lex inside. Tim and Lex are pursued by the raptors in an industrial kitchen but they escape and join Grant and Sattler. Lex restores full power from the control room allowing the group to call Hammond who in turn calls for help. The group is cornered by the raptors but they are able to escape when the Tyrannosaurus suddenly appears and kills the raptors. Hammond arrives in a Jeep with Malcolm and the entire group boards a helicopter to leave the island."

As the Germans begin to lose the war Göth is ordered to ship the remaining Jews at Płaszów to Auschwitz concentration camp. Schindler asks Göth to allow him to move his workers to a new munitions factory he plans to build in Brinnlitz near his home town Zwittau. Göth agrees but charges a huge bribe. Schindler and Stern create ""Schindler's List"" – a list of about 850 people to be transferred to Brinnlitz and thus saved from transport to Auschwitz.
The train carrying the women and children is accidentally redirected to Auschwitz-Birkenau; Schindler bribes Rudolf Höss the commandant of Auschwitz with a bag of diamonds to win their release. At the new factory Schindler forbids the SS guards from entering the factory floor and encourages the Jews to observe the Jewish Sabbath. Over the next seven months he spends much of his fortune bribing Nazi officials and buying shell casings from other companies; due to Schindler's own machinations the factory does not produce any usable armaments during this period. Schindler runs out of money in 1945 just as Germany surrenders ending the war in Europe.
As a Nazi Party member and war profiteer Schindler must flee the advancing Red Army to avoid capture. The SS guards in Schindler's factory have been ordered to kill the Jewish workforce but Schindler persuades them not to so that they can ""return to [their] families as men instead of murderers."" He bids farewell to his workers and prepares to head west hoping to surrender to the Americans. The workers give Schindler a signed statement attesting to his role in saving Jewish lives and present him with a ring engraved with a Talmudic quotation: ""Whoever saves one life saves the world entire."" Schindler is touched but also ashamed as he feels he should have done even more. As the Schindlerjuden wake up the next morning a Soviet soldier arrives to announce that they have been liberated. The Jews leave the factory and walk to a nearby town."
Amistad(Spielberg),"La Amistad is the name of a slave ship traveling from Cuba to the United States in 1839. It is carrying African slaves as its cargo. As the ship is crossing from Cuba to the United States Cinqué a leader of the Africans leads a mutiny and takes over the ship. The mutineers spare the lives of two Spanish navigators to help them sail the ship back to Africa. Instead the navigators misdirect the Africans and sail north to the east coast of the United States where the ship is stopped by the American Navy and the living Africans imprisoned as runaway slaves.
In an unfamiliar country and not speaking a single word of English the Africans find themselves in a legal battle. District Attorney William S. Holabird brings charges of piracy and murder. Secretary of State John Forsyth on behalf of President Martin Van Buren (who is campaigning for re-election) represents the claim of Queen Isabella II of Spain that the Africans are slaves and are property of Spain based on a treaty. Two Naval officers claim them as salvage while the two Spanish navigators produce proof of purchase. A lawyer named Roger Sherman Baldwin hired by the abolitionist Lewis Tappan and his black associate Theodore Joadson decides to defend the Africans.
Baldwin argues that the Africans had been captured in Africa to be sold in the Americas illegally. Baldwin proves through documents found hidden aboard La Amistad that the African people were initially cargo belonging to a Portuguese slave ship the Tecora. Therefore the Africans were free citizens of another country and not slaves at all. In light of this evidence the staff of President Van Buren has the judge presiding over the case replaced by Judge Coglin who is younger and believed to be impressionable and easily influenced. Consequently seeking to make the case more personal on the advice of former American president (and lawyer) John Quincy Adams Baldwin and Joadson find James Covey a former slave who speaks both Mende and English. Cinque tells his story at trial: Cinque was kidnapped by slave traders outside his village and held in the slave fortress of Lomboko where thousands of captives were held under heavy guard. Cinque and many others were then sold to the Tecora where they were held in the brig of the ship. The captives were beaten and whipped and at times were given so little food that they had to eat the food from each other's faces. One day 50 captives were thrown overboard. Later on the ship arrived in Havana Cuba. Those captives that were not sold at auction were handed over to La Amistad.
District Attorney Holabird attacks Cinqué's ""tale"" of being captured and kept in the slave fortress and especially questions the throwing of precious cargo overboard. However the Royal Navy's fervent abolitionist Captain Fitzgerald of the West Africa Squadron backs up Cinqué's account. Baldwin shows from the Tecora's inventory that the number of African people taken as slaves was reduced by 50. Fitzgerald explains that some slave ships when interdicted do this to get rid of the evidence for their crime. But in the Tecora's case they had underestimated the amount of provisions necessary for their journey. As the tension rises Cinqué stands up from his seat and repeatedly cries ""Give us us free!""
Judge Coglin rules in favor of the Africans. After pressure from Senator John C. Calhoun of South Carolina on President Van Buren the case is appealed to the Supreme Court. Despite refusing to help when the case was initially presented Adams agrees to assist with the case. At the Supreme Court he makes an impassioned and eloquent plea for their release and is successful.
The Lomboko slave fortress is liberated by the Royal Marines under the command of Captain Fitzgerald. After all the slaves were hurried out of the fortress Fitzgerald orders the ship's cannon to destroy it. He then dictates a letter to Forsyth saying that he was right—the slave fortress doesn't exist.
Because of the release of the Africans Van Buren loses his re-election campaign and tension builds between the North and the South which would eventually culminate in the Civil War."
The Lost World: Jurassic Park(Spielberg),"On Isla Sorna an island off the Costa Rican coast a young girl named Cathy Bowman wanders around during a family vacation and survives an attack by a swarm of Compsognathus. Her parents file a lawsuit against the genetics company InGen now headed by John Hammond's nephew Peter Ludlow who plans to use Isla Sorna to alleviate the financial losses imposed by the incident that occurred at Jurassic Park four years earlier. Mathematician Dr. Ian Malcolm meets Hammond at his mansion. Hammond explains that Isla Sorna abandoned years earlier during a hurricane is where InGen created their dinosaurs before moving them to Jurassic Park on Isla Nublar. Hammond hopes to stop InGen by sending a team to Isla Sorna to document the dinosaurs thus causing public support against human interference on the island. Ian who survived the Jurassic Park disaster is reluctant. After learning that his girlfriend paleontologist Dr. Sarah Harding is part of the team and is already on Isla Sorna Ian agrees to go to the island but only to retrieve her.
Ian meets his teammates Eddie Carr an equipment specialist and engineer and Nick Van Owen a video documentarian and activist. After arriving on the island they locate Sarah and discover that Ian's daughter Kelly had stowed away in a trailer being used as a mobile base. They then watch as another InGen team – consisting of mercenaries hunters paleontologists and Ludlow – arrive to capture several dinosaurs. Meanwhile team leader Roland Tembo a big-game hunter hopes to capture a male Tyrannosaurus by luring it to the cries of its injured infant. That night Ian's team sneak into the InGen camp and learn the captured dinosaurs will be brought to a newly proposed theme park in San Diego. This prompts Nick and Sarah to free the caged dinosaurs wreaking havoc upon the camp.
Nick also frees the infant T. rex and takes it to the trailer to mend its broken leg. After securing Kelly with Eddie Ian realizes the infant's parents are searching for it and rushes to the trailer. As soon as Ian arrives the infant's parents emerge on both sides of the trailer. The infant is released to the adult T. rexes which then attack the trailer pushing it over the edge of a nearby cliff. Eddie soon arrives but as he tries to pull the trailer back over the edge with an SUV the adult T. rexes return and devour him. The trailer and the SUV plummet off the cliff. Ian Sarah and Nick are rescued by the InGen team along with Kelly. With both groups' communications equipment and vehicles destroyed they team up to search for the old InGen compound's radio station on foot. Dieter a member of the InGen hunter team is killed by a pack of Compsognathus.
The next night the two adult T. rexes find the group's camp as they had followed the infant's blood scent on Sarah's jacket. The female T. rex chases the group to a waterfall cave and devours the hunter team's dinosaur expert Dr. Robert Burke while Roland tranquilizes the male. Much of the remaining InGen team is killed by Velociraptors while fleeing through a tall grass savannah. Nick runs ahead to the communications center at the InGen Worker's Village to call for rescue. After Ian Sarah and Kelly reach the village they evade raptors until a helicopter arrives and transports them off the island.
A freighter ship transports the male T. rex to San Diego but crashes into the dock. After finding the ship's crew killed a guard opens the cargo hold accidentally releasing the T. rex which escapes into the city and goes on a destructive rampage. Ian and Sarah retrieve the infant T. rex from InGen's unfinished Jurassic Park San Diego facility and use it to lure the adult back to the ship. Ludlow tries to intervene but is trapped in the cargo hold by the adult T. rex and is subsequently mauled to death by the infant. Before the adult can escape again Sarah tranquilizes it while Ian closes the cargo hold doors. The T. rexes are escorted back to Isla Sorna and Hammond says that the American and Costa Rican governments have agreed to declare the island a nature preserve securing the island from any human interference affirming that ""life will find a way""."
Saving Private Ryan(Spielberg),"An elderly veteran visits the Normandy American Cemetery and Memorial with his family. Upon seeing one particular grave he falls to his knees overcome with emotion. The scene then shifts to the morning of June 6 1944 as American soldiers land on Omaha Beach as part of the Normandy Invasion. They suffer heavy losses in assaulting German defensive positions of artillery and machine guns raining down intense fire on the American forces. Captain John H. Miller of the 2nd Ranger Battalion assembles a group to penetrate the German defenses leading to a breakout from the beach. Elsewhere on the beach a dead soldier lies face-down in the bloody surf; his pack is stenciled Ryan S.
In Washington D.C. at the U.S. War Department General George Marshall learns that three of the four brothers of the Ryan family were killed in action and that the fourth son James has been parachuted somewhere over Normandy but is currently unable to be located. He is also informed that their mother will receive all three telegrams notifying her of her three sons' deaths on the same day. After reading Abraham Lincoln's Bixby letter aloud for his staff he orders that James Ryan be found and returned home immediately.
Three days after D-Day Miller receives orders to find Ryan and bring him back from the front. He assembles six men from his company—T/Sgt. Mike Horvath Privates First Class Richard Reiben and Adrian Caparzo Privates Stanley Mellish and Danny Jackson medic Irwin Wade—plus T/5 Timothy Upham a cartographer and interpreter borrowed from another unit. They move out to Neuville where they meet a squad from the 101st Airborne Division where Caparzo is killed by a German sniper quickly taken out by Jackson. They locate a Private James Ryan but quickly learn he is not their man. They eventually encounter a friend of James Ryan who tells them that he is defending an important bridge in the town of Ramelle.
On the way to Ramelle Miller decides to neutralize a German machine gun position at a derelict radar station despite his men's misgivings; Wade is killed in the skirmish. Miller at Upham's urging declines to execute a surviving German soldier (nicknamed ""Steamboat Willie"") and sets him free on the condition that he surrender to the first Allied unit he encounters. Losing confidence in Miller's leadership Reiben declares his intention to desert prompting a confrontation with Horvath which Miller defuses by disclosing his civilian background as a teacher about which his men had set up a betting pool. Reiben reluctantly decides to stay.
Outside Ramelle Miller and the squad encounters a German half-track with troops and ambush them together with three paratroopers one of whom is Ryan. In the town Miller's squad find a small group of paratroopers preparing to defend the key bridge and where Miller tells Ryan about his brothers and their orders to bring him home with two of his men having been lost in finding him. He is distressed at the loss of his brothers but asks Miller to tell his mother that he intends to stay ""with the only brothers [he has] left."" Miller decides to join his unit with the paratroopers in defense of the bridge against the imminent German attack. Miller forms ambush positions throughout the ruined town preparing to attack arriving tanks and infantry with mines Molotov cocktails detonation cords and ""sticky bombs"" made from socks filled with Composition B smeared with thick grease.
Elements of the 2nd SS Panzer Division arrive with infantry and armor comprising two Tiger I tanks and two Marder tank destroyers/light assault guns. Although they managed to inflict heavy casualties on the Germans including destroying one Tiger tank and both Marders most of the paratroopers along with Jackson Mellish and Horvath are killed while Upham avoids fighting due to his jittery nerves and hides himself from his German foes. Miller attempts to blow up the bridge but is shot and mortally wounded by Steamboat Willie who had somehow rejoined the Germans. In confusion and supposed desperation after suffering intense German fire Miller crawls to the middle of the bridge and attempts to open fire on the oncoming German tank and accompanying troops with his pistol. Just before the last Tiger tank reaches the bridge an American P-51 Mustang flies overhead and destroys the tank followed by American armored units which rout the remaining Germans. Witnessing Miller's shooting Upham leaps out from his hiding and confronts Steamboat Willie and his group as they attempt to retreat. Steamboat Willie raises his hands in surrender and smiles believing that Upham will accept because of their earlier encounter. Instead Upham kills him but lets the other Germans flee.
Reiben and Ryan are with Miller as he dies and utters his last words ""James...earn this. Earn it.""
The elderly veteran is revealed to be Ryan and the grave he is standing at is Miller’s. Ryan expresses his appreciation for what Miller and the others did for him. He then asks his wife if he is a ""good man"" worthy of their sacrifices to which she tells him he is. Ryan comes to attention and salutes Miller's grave."

Minority Report(Spielberg),"In April 2054 Washington DC's PreCrime police stops murderers before they act reducing the murder rate to zero. Murders are predicted using three mutated humans called ""Precogs"" who ""previsualize"" crimes by receiving visions of the future. Would-be murderers are imprisoned in their own happy virtual reality. The Federal government is on the verge of adopting the controversial program.
Since the disappearance of his son Sean PreCrime Captain John Anderton has both separated from his wife Lara and become a drug addict. While United States Department of Justice agent Danny Witwer is auditing the program the Precogs generate a new prediction implying Anderton will murder a man named Leo Crow in 36 hours. Anderton does not know Crow but flees the area as Witwer begins a manhunt. Anderton seeks the advice of Dr. Iris Hineman the creator of PreCrime technology. She reveals that sometimes one of the Precogs usually Agatha has a different vision than the other two a ""minority report"" of a possible alternate future; this has been kept a secret as it would damage the system's credibility. Anderton resolves to recover the minority report to prove his innocence.
Anderton goes to a black market doctor for a risky eye transplant so as to avoid the citywide optical recognition system. He returns to PreCrime and kidnaps Agatha shutting down the system as the Precogs operate as a group mind. Anderton takes Agatha to a hacker to extract the minority report of Leo Crow but none exists; instead Agatha shows him an image of the murder of Ann Lively a woman who was drowned by a hooded figure in 2049.
Anderton and Agatha go to Crow's hotel room as the 36-hour time nears finding numerous photos of children including Sean's. Crow arrives and Anderton prepares to kill him accusing him of being a serial child killer. Agatha talks Anderton out of shooting Crow by telling him that he has the ability to choose his future now that he is aware of it. Crow however begs to be killed having been hired to plant the photos and be killed in exchange for his family's financial well being. Crow grabs Anderton's gun and pushes the trigger killing himself. Anderton and Agatha flee to Lara's house outside the city for refuge. There they learn Lively was Agatha's drug-addicted mother who sold her to PreCrime. Lively had sobered up and attempted to reclaim Agatha but was murdered. Anderton realizes he is being targeted for knowing about Lively's existence and her connection to Agatha.
Witwer studying Crow's death suspects Anderton is being framed. He examines the footage of Lively's murder and finds there were two attempts on her life the first having been stopped by PreCrime but the second occurring minutes later having succeeded. Witwer reports this to the director and founder of PreCrime Lamar Burgess but Burgess responds by killing Witwer using Anderton's gun. With the Precogs still offline the murder is not detected.
Lara calls Burgess to reveal that Anderton is with her and Anderton is captured accused of both murders and fitted with the brain device that puts him permanently into a dreamlike sleep. As his body is deposited into the prison the warden tells him ""that all your dreams come true”.
Agatha is reconnected to the PreCrime system. While attempting to comfort Lara Burgess accidentally reveals himself as Lively's murderer. Lara frees Anderton from stasis and Anderton exposes Burgess at a PreCrime celebratory banquet by playing the full video of Agatha's vision of Burgess killing Lively. A new report is generated at PreCrime: Burgess will kill Anderton. Burgess corners Anderton and explains that as he could not afford to let Lively take Agatha back without impacting PreCrime he arranged to kill Lively following an actual attempt on her life so that the murder would appear as an echo to the technician within PreCrime and be ignored. Anderton points out Burgess's dilemma: If Burgess kills Anderton he will be imprisoned for life but PreCrime will be validated; if he spares Anderton PreCrime will be discredited and shut down. Anderton reveals the ultimate flaw of the system: once people are aware of their future they are able to change it. Burgess shoots himself.
After Burgess's death the PreCrime system is shut down. All the prisoners are unconditionally pardoned and released although they are kept under occasional surveillance. Anderton and Lara are soon to have a new child together. The Precogs are sent to an undisclosed location to live their lives in peace."
The Terminal(Spielberg),"Viktor Navorski a traveler from the nation of Krakozhia arrives at New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport only to find that his passport is suddenly no longer valid. The United States no longer recognizes Krakozhia as a sovereign nation after the outbreak of a civil war and Viktor is not permitted to either enter the country or return home as he is now stateless.

With no other choice Navorski settles in at the terminal with only his luggage and a peanut can much to the frustration of Frank Dixon the temporary customs director for the airport. Dixon is being considered for a promotion and becomes obsessed with getting rid of Navorski. Meanwhile Navorski befriends and helps airport employees and travelers. Among them a flight attendant named Amelia Warren whom he sees periodically and tries to woo presenting himself as a building contractor who is frequently traveling. Navorski had been hired by an airport contractor and paid under the table after he impulsively remodeled a wall at a gate that was scheduled for future renovation.
One day Dixon pulls Amelia aside and questions whether she knows Navorski's true situation. Amelia confronts Navorski at his makeshift home where he shows her that the peanut can contains a copy of the photograph A Great Day in Harlem. His late father was a jazz enthusiast who had discovered the famous portrait in a Hungarian newspaper in 1958 and vowed to collect the autographs of all 57 of the musicians featured on it. He died before he could get the last one from tenor saxophonist Benny Golson. Navorski has come to New York to do so. After hearing the story Amelia kisses Navorski.
After nine months Navorski friends wake him with the news that the war in Krakozhia has ended.

Moreover Navorski finds out that Dixon must sign the visa. Seizing the opportunity Dixon threatens to cause trouble for Navorski's friends most seriously by deporting janitor Gupta back to India where he is wanted for attempted murder. Unwilling to let this happen Navorski finally agrees to go home to Krakozhia. When Gupta learns of this however he runs in front of the plane as it taxies to the terminal resulting in his deportation effectively taking the burden off Navorski.
The delay gives Navorski enough time to go into the city. Dixon watching Navorski leave the airport decides not to pursue him. Navorski arrives in New York at the hotel where Benny Golson is performing and finally collects the last autograph. Then he gets in a taxi telling the driver ""I am going home."""
Munich(Spielberg),"At the 1972 Munich Olympics the Palestinian terrorist group Black September kills eleven members of the Israeli Olympic team. Avner Kaufman a Mossad agent of German-Jewish descent is chosen to lead a mission to assassinate 11 Palestinians allegedly involved in the massacre. At the direction of his handler Ephraim to give the Israeli government plausible deniability Avner resigns from Mossad and operates with no official ties to Israel. His team includes four Jewish volunteers from around the world: South African driver Steve Belgian toy-maker and explosives expert Robert former Israeli soldier and ""cleaner"" Carl and Danish document forger Hans. They are given information by a French informant Louis.
In Rome the team shoots and kills Wael Zwaiter who is living as a poet. In Paris they detonate a bomb in the home of Mahmoud Hamshari; in Cyprus they bomb the hotel room of Hussein Abd Al Chir. With IDF commandos they pursue three Palestinians—Muhammad Youssef al-Najjar Kamal Adwan and Kamal Nasser—to Beirut penetrate the Palestinians' guarded compound and kill all three.

Avner makes a brief visit to his wife who has given birth to their first baby. In Athens when they track down Zaiad Muchasi the team finds out that Louis arranged for them to share a safe house with their rival PLO members and the Mossad agents escape trouble by pretending to be members of foreign terrorist groups like ETA IRA ANC and the Red Army Faction.

The squad moves to London to track down Ali Hassan Salameh who orchestrated the Munich Massacre but the assassination attempt is interrupted by several drunken Americans. It is implied that these are agents of the CIA which according to Louis protects and funds Salameh in exchange for his promise not to attack U.S. diplomats.

A disillusioned Avner flies to Israel where he is unhappy to be hailed as a hero by two young soldiers and then to his new home in Brooklyn where he suffers post-traumatic stress and paranoia. He is thrown out of the Israeli consulate after storming in to demand that Mossad leave his wife and child alone. Ephraim comes to ask Avner to return to Israel and Mossad but Avner refuses."
War of the Worlds(Spielberg),"An opening narration explains how humans were unaware that a race of extraterrestrials was making plans to occupy Earth.
Ray Ferrier is a divorced crane operator longshoreman who works at a dock in Brooklyn New York and lives in Bayonne New Jersey. Ray is estranged from his children. His former wife Mary Ann later drops off the children 10-year-old daughter Rachel and teenage son Robbie at Ray's house on her way to visit her parents in Boston. Unexplained changes in the weather occur with lightning that strikes multiple times in the middle of an intersection and disrupts all electricity.
Ray joins the crowd at the scene of the lightning strikes where a massive ""Tripod"" war machine emerges from the ground and uses powerful weaponry to destroy the area disintegrating most of the witnesses into a grey dust and leaving only their empty clothes behind. Ray collects his children steals a car that had just been repaired and drives to Mary Ann's empty home in suburban New Jersey to take refuge. The next morning he finds that a Boeing 747 has crashed in the street. A news team scavenging for food and surveying the wreckage explain that there are multiple Tripods that have attacked major cities including New York City Paris Washington D.C. and London and have force shields to protect them from human weapons. They also explain the Tripods' pilots traveled to Earth within the lightning as a way to enter them which were buried on Earth millions of years prior. Ray decides to take the kids to Boston to be with their mother. The three are forced to abandon their car after a mob sees that it's working and swarms the vehicle. They later survive a Tripod attack which causes a Hudson River ferry to sink. During a desperate battle between U.S. Marines and the aliens Ray is forced to choose between being separated from Rachel and preventing Robbie from joining the fight: he lets Robbie go with the Marines to what appears to be certain death. While escaping Ray and Rachel are offered shelter in the basement of a farmhouse by a man named Harlan Ogilvy.
The three remain undetected for two days even as a probe and a group of aliens themselves explore the basement. They discover that the aliens are cultivating a strange red-colored growth (known as ""Red weed"") across the landscape and it is quickly spreading covering trees and making its way into the basement: the group deduces the aliens are modifying Earth to be more like their home planet. The next morning Ogilvy suffers a mental breakdown after witnessing a Tripod harvesting human blood and tissue to fertilize the alien vegetation. Convinced that Ogilvy's mad shouting will alert the Martians to their location Ray reluctantly kills him. The basement hideout is eventually exposed when a second probe catches the Ferriers sleeping. Rachel is abducted by a nearby Tripod and Ray allows himself to be abducted as well after picking up a belt of grenades from an abandoned military vehicle. Ray and a number of other abductees use the belt to destroy the Tripod from within freeing them all.
Ray and Rachel arrive in a devastated Boston where they discover the alien vegetation is shriveling up and most of the Tripods have collapsed. When an active Tripod appears Ray notices birds landing on it indicating that its shields are offline. Ray alerts the soldiers escorting the fleeing crowd and they shoot it down with anti-tank missiles. As the soldiers advance on the downed Tripod a hatch opens and a sickly alien struggles halfway out before dying.

Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull(Spielberg),"In 1957 Indiana Jones and his partner George ""Mac"" McHale are kidnapped by Soviet agents under Colonel Dr. Irina Spalko who infiltrate a warehouse labeled ""Warehouse 51"" and force Jones to locate a mummified corpse recovered from a crash site. Upon its discovery Mac reveals he is a double agent working for the Soviets. Jones escapes and unsuccessfully attempts to retrieve the body. After a fight with Spalko's sadistic henchman Colonel Antonin Dovchenko Jones escapes to a model town at the Nevada Test Site minutes before an atomic bomb test and takes shelter in a lead-lined refrigerator. Jones is rescued decontaminated and apprehended by FBI agents who suspect him of working for the Soviets; though freed on the recommendation of General Ross who vouches for him he is put on indefinite leave of absence from Marshall College. His leaving also causes the dean's resignation to keep Indiana's job at the college.
Jones is approached by greaser Mutt Williams who tells him that Harold Oxley had found a crystal skull in Peru suffered a mental breakdown and was later kidnapped. Jones tells Mutt about the legend of crystal skulls found in Akator. Mutt gives Jones a letter from his mother who is also held captive containing a riddle written by Oxley in an ancient South American language. KGB agents attempt to capture them but Jones and Mutt escape them and reach Peru. At the local psychiatric hospital Oxley's scribbles on the walls and floor of his cell lead them to the grave of Francisco de Orellana a Conquistador who searched for Akator. They discover the skull at the grave with Jones reasoning that Oxley had returned it there.
Jones and Mutt are captured by Mac and the Soviets and taken to their camp in the Amazon jungle where they find Oxley and Mutt's mother Marion Ravenwood who reveals that Mutt is Jones's son Henry Jones III. Spalko believes the crystal skull belongs to an alien life form and holds great psychic power and that finding more skulls in Akator will grant the Soviets the advantage of psychic warfare. Spalko uses the skull on Jones to enable him to understand Oxley and identify a route to Akator. Jones and his four allies escape with the skull but Marion and Jones get caught into a dry sandpit to be recaptured by the Soviets after Oxley accidentally brings them as assistance. On their way to Akator Mac tells Jones he is a CIA double-agent to regain Jones's trust and Jones's team fights its way out of the Soviets' clutches while Dovchenko is devoured by siafu ants. Jones and his allies cause many of the Soviets to fall from a cliff and they survive three waterfalls in an amphibious vehicle. Jones and Oxley identify a skull-like rock formation that leads them to Akator unaware that Mac lied about being a CIA agent is still loyal to Spalko and has been dropping transceivers to allow the surviving Soviets to track them.
The adventurers evade the city's guardians gain access to the temple and find it filled with artifacts from many ancient civilizations identifying the aliens as extra-dimensional ""archaeologists"" studying the different cultures of Earth. They find and enter a chamber containing the crystal skeletons of thirteen alien beings one missing its skull. Spalko arrives and presents the skull to its skeleton whereupon the aliens reanimate and telepathically offer a reward in ancient Mayan through Oxley. A portal to their dimension becomes activated and the other remaining Soviets are drawn into the portal. As Jones Marion Mutt and Oxley–who has regained his sanity–escape the thirteen beings fuse into one and in the process of receiving the overwhelming knowledge Spalko is disintegrated and sucked into the portal. Mac is caught in the vortex while trying to scrounge some of the treasure and even though Jones offers him his whip to pull him to safety he willingly lets go and is sucked in. Jones and the others escape and watch as the city crumbles revealing a flying saucer rising from under the ground and vanishing while the hollow in the valley floor left by its departure is flooded by the waters of the Amazon.
The following year Jones is reinstated at Marshall College and made an associate dean and he and Marion are married. Before the wedding party leaves the chapel a gust of wind blows Indy's brown fedora off the coat rack and deposits it at Mutt's feet. Mutt picks it up and is about to don it before Jones snatches it from his hands and puts it on with a grin."
The Adventures of Tintin: The Secret of the Unicorn(Spielberg),"Young journalist Tintin and his dog Snowy are browsing in an outdoor market in 1950s England. Tintin buys a miniature model of a ship the Unicorn but is accosted by an Interpol officer Barnaby and a ship collector Ivan Ivanovitch Sakharine who both unsuccessfully tried to buy the model from Tintin. Tintin takes the ship home but it is accidentally broken in an incident between Snowy and a cat. A parchment scroll slips out and rolls under a piece of furniture. Meanwhile bumbling police detectives Thomson and Thompson are on the trail of a pickpocket Aristides Silk.
After visiting Maritime Library to uncover the history surrounding the Unicorn Tintin returns to find that the Unicorn has been stolen suspecting Sakharine. He visits Marlinspike Hall and accuses him of the theft. After arguing Tintin begins to notice that Sakharine's model is not broken realizing that there are two Unicorn models. After returning home once again Tintin finds out that his apartment had been ransacked. Snowy shows him the scroll but shortly after reading an old message written on it they are interrupted by the arrival of Barnaby who is then assassinated while attempting to recover the Unicorn. Tintin places the scroll in his wallet but it is stolen by Silk the next morning after a scuffle with the police detectives.
Later Tintin is abducted by accomplices of Sakharine and imprisoned on the SS Karaboudjan. He learns that Sakharine formed an alliance with the ship's staff and led a mutiny to take over control. On board Tintin meets Captain Haddock the ship's captain. Haddock is permanently drunk and thus unaware of most of his past. Tintin Haddock and Snowy eventually outrun the crew and escape from the Karaboudjan in a lifeboat. The ship fails to ram their boat because they instead rammed an empty lifeboat the captain accidentally released during his escape. Presuming them to have survived by the number of lifeboats Sakharine sends a seaplane to find and capture them. The trio seizes the plane and use it to fly towards the fictitious Moroccan port of Bagghar. However the seaplane crashes in the desert due to low fuel and a thunderstorm.
While trekking through the desert Haddock hallucinates and remembers facts about an ancestor of his Sir Francis Haddock who was a 17th-century captain of the Unicorn. Sir Francis's treasure-laden ship was attacked by the crew of a pirate ship led by Red Rackham and after his eventual surrender Sir Francis sank the Unicorn and most of the treasure to prevent it from falling into Rackham's hands. It implies that there were three Unicorn models each containing a scroll; together the scrolls can reveal coordinates of the location of the sunken Unicorn and its treasure.
The third model is in Bagghar possessed by Omar ben Salaad. Sakharine causes a distraction in a Bianca Castafiore concert that results in him successfully stealing the third scroll. After a chase through the city he gains all the scrolls by having his men toss Captain Haddock and Snowy in the water to force Tintin to go after them instead of saving the scrolls. After the boat leaves Tintin is ready to give up but is persuaded by Haddock to continue. With help from officers Thompson and Thomson Tintin and Haddock track Sakharine down who is revealed to be a descendant of Red Rackham. They head back to port and set up a trap but Sakharine uses his pistol to resist arrest. When his men fail to save him Sakharine challenges Haddock to a final showdown. Sakharine and Haddock sword-duel with cranes and swords eventually resulting in Sakharine being defeated and pushed overboard by Haddock. When climbing ashore Sakharine is arrested by Thomson and Thompson.
Guided by the three scrolls indicating the location of Marlinspike Hall Tintin and Haddock find there some of the treasure and a clue to the Unicorn's location. Both men agree on setting up an expedition to find the shipwreck."
Lincoln(Spielberg),"In January 1865 President Abraham Lincoln expects the Civil War to end soon with the defeat of the Confederate States. He is concerned that his 1863 Emancipation Proclamation may be discarded by the courts after the war and the proposed Thirteenth Amendment will be defeated by the returning slave states. He feels it imperative to pass the amendment beforehand to remove any possibility that freed slaves might be re-enslaved.
The Radical Republicans fear the amendment will be defeated by some who wish to delay its passage; support from Republicans in the border states is not yet assured. The amendment also requires the support of several Democratic congressmen to pass. With dozens of Democrats being lame ducks after losing their re-election campaigns in the fall of 1864 some of Lincoln's advisors believe he should wait for a new Republican-heavy Congress. Lincoln remains adamant about having the amendment in place before the war is concluded and the southern states readmitted.
Lincoln's hopes rely upon the support of Francis Preston Blair a founder of the Republican Party whose influence could win over members of the western and border state conservative faction. With Union victory in the Civil War highly likely but not yet secured and with two sons serving in the Union Army Blair is keen to end hostilities. Therefore in return for his support Blair insists that Lincoln allow him immediately to engage the Confederate government in peace negotiations. Yet Lincoln knows that significant support for the amendment comes from Radical Republicans for whom negotiated peace is unacceptable. Unable to proceed without Blair's support Lincoln reluctantly authorizes Blair's mission.
In the meantime Lincoln and Secretary of State William Seward work to secure Democratic votes for the amendment. Lincoln suggests they concentrate on the lame duck Democrats as they will feel freer to vote as they choose and will also soon need employment; Lincoln will have many federal jobs to fill as he begins his second term. Though Lincoln and Seward are unwilling to offer monetary bribes to the Democrats they authorize agents to contact Democratic congressmen with offers of federal jobs in exchange for their support.
At a key moment in the debate racial-equality advocate Thaddeus s agrees to moderate his position and argue that the amendment represents only legal equality not a declaration of actual equality. Meanwhile Confederate envoys are ready to meet with Lincoln to discuss terms for peace but he instructs they be kept out of Washington as the amendment approaches a vote on the House floor. Rumor of their mission circulates prompting both Democrats and conservative Republicans to advocate postponing the vote. But in a carefully worded statement Lincoln denies there are envoys in Washington and the vote proceeds passing by a margin of just two votes. Black visitors to the gallery celebrate and s returns home to his ""housekeeper"" and lover a black woman(negro).
When Lincoln meets with the Confederates he tells them slavery cannot be restored as the North is united for ratification of the amendment and several of the southern states' reconstructed legislatures would also vote to ratify. On April 3 Lincoln visits the battlefield at Petersburg Virginia where he exchanges a few words with Lieutenant General Ulysses S. Grant. Six days later Grant receives General Robert E. Lee's surrender at Appomattox Courthouse.
On April 14 Lincoln is meeting members of his cabinet to discuss future measures to enfranchise blacks when he is reminded that First Lady Mary Todd Lincoln is waiting to take them to their evening at Ford's Theatre. That night while Lincoln's son Tad is watching Aladdin and the Wonderful Lamp at Grover's Theatre the manager suddenly stops the play to announce that the President has been shot. The next morning Lincoln dies; Secretary of War Edwin Stanton declares ""Now he belongs to the ages""."
The BFG(Spielberg),"Sophie a 10-year-old orphaned girl who lives in a London orphanage stays awake reading through the nights due to her insomnia. At 3:00 am or what she calls the ""witching hour"" she sees an elderly giant outside her window. The giant captures her and takes her into Giant Country. There he explains that Sophie must stay with him for the rest of her life because she saw him and must not be allowed to reveal the existence of giants. He also explains that she will put herself at risk if she goes out in the open as nine other giants inhabit Giant Country all of whom are maneaters and favor the taste of children.
When Sophie awakes the Fleshlumpeater the infantile leader of the man-eating giants (and the same one from Sophie's nightmare) enters the older giant's home and smells Sophie. The Fleshlumpeater nearly devours Sophie before exiting. The giant gives Sophie some replacement clothes as hers are ruined and Sophie convinces him to take her to Dream Country to catch dreams together. As they leave they accidentally wake up the Bloodbottler the more intelligent and cunning second-in-command to the Fleshlumpeater who awakens the other man-eating giants. They torment and bully the friendly giant by throwing him around like a football and rolling him down a hill in a garbage truck. As the pair escape during a thunderstorm which drives the man-eating giants into the cave the Fleshlumpeater and the Bloodbottler find Sophie's blanket (which she had dropped before) and plan to find her. Climbing up the mountain Sophie tells the giant that he shouldn't allow the other giants to bully him.
The pair arrives in Dream Country and catch a dream each. While there the giant reveals that his only other alias (other than ""runt"" which the other giants call him) is ""the Big Friendly Giant"" and Sophie decides to call him ""BFG"". The two then head to London to spread good dreams to sleeping children. As they do so Sophie realizes that she has lost her blanket. The BFG realizes that the other man-eating giants know about her and she wakes up outside the orphanage. He explains that the last human child he took and raised was discovered and eaten by Fleshlumpeater's group. She throws herself out of her window in the hope he will appear again to catch her and he does.
When they return to the BFG's home the other giants barge in and upend the place looking for Sophie destroying much of the BFG's hard work. Sophie evades detection and the enraged BFG finally stands up to them and drives them off with a hot fire iron. While hidden Sophie finds the home of the last human to live with the BFG before becoming a victim of Fleshlumpeater's group. She leaves his jacket on his bed and finds a portrait of Queen Victoria amongst his belongings. From this she devises a plan to forge a nightmare and give it to Elizabeth II the Queen of the United Kingdom. The nightmare consists of giants eating the children of England the British Army fighting the giants and Sophie appearing on her windowsill.
They head to Buckingham Palace where upon waking from her nightmare the Queen and her maid Mary find Sophie on the windowsill as in the nightmare with the BFG outside in the palace grounds. Sophie and the BFG inform the Queen Mary and Mr. Tibbs that the child-eating beasts in her dream are indeed real and must be stopped at all costs before they cause any more harm to her subjects. After a large breakfast they all enjoy the Queen soon dispatches soldiers to Giant Country.
The BFG plans to give the man-eating giants the nightmare Sophie caught the night before so they will be more compliant once caught. They are almost all immediately consumed by guilt but the Fleshlumpeater awakens and intercepts the nightmare before it can affect him. Despite this the British army's helicopters effortlessly ensnare and capture him and the other giants. They are lifted away onto an isolated uncharted island somewhere in the world where numerous snozzcumbers and a large crate of snozzcumber seeds are left with them much to their fury.
In the aftermath Sophie begins living in the Queen's palace with Mary while the BFG returns to Giant Country to resume giving dreams to people and begins growing a wide variety of vegetables inspired by his time in England. The film ends with Sophie narrating that whenever she feels lonely which is less often than before she talks to him. He can still hear her. Leaning out of her window she says ""Good Morning BFG"". At his writing desk the BFG hears her words and smiles."
The Post(Spielberg),"In 1966 Vietnam State Department military analyst Daniel Ellsberg accompanies U.S. troops in combat documenting the progress of U.S. military activities in the region for Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara. On the flight home McNamara expresses to Ellsberg and William Macomber his view that the war in Vietnam is hopeless yet upon landing tells the press he has every confidence in the war effort. Ellsberg overhears this and becomes disillusioned. Years later as a civilian military contractor working for the RAND Corporation Ellsberg surreptitiously photocopies classified reports documenting the country's decades-long involvement in the conflict in Vietnam dating back to the Truman administration. Ellsberg then leaks these documents to reporters at The New York Times; the movie follows two weeks in 1971 at The Washington Post and the publishing of the Pentagon Papers.
Newspaper heiress Katharine Graham tries to balance her social life with her responsibility as owner and publisher of The Washington Post following the deaths of her husband Phil Graham and her father Eugene Meyer. She is troubled over preparations for the newspaper's stock-market launch a move she recognizes as important for strengthening the paper's economic stability. Graham lacks experience and is frequently overruled by more assertive men who advise or work for her such as editor-in-chief Ben Bradlee and board member Arthur Parsons. Bradlee tries in vain to match The New York Times's ability to get scoops. Meanwhile McNamara Graham's longtime friend confides in her that he is to be the subject of unflattering coverage by the Times. The story turns out to be an exposé of the government's long-running deception of the American public. However the series is halted by a court injunction against further publication by the Times.
Post assistant editor Ben Bagdikian tracks down Ellsberg as the source for the leak who provides Bagdikian with copies of the same material given to the Times. A hand-picked team of Post reporters sorts through the piles of papers searching for the headline stories. The lawyers for the Post advise against publishing the material lest the Nixon administration bring criminal charges against them. Graham talks to McNamara Bradlee and trusted Post chairman Fritz Beebe agonizing over the decision of whether to publish. The situation is made even more complicated when the Post's lawyers discover that Bagdikian's source is the same as the Times's possibly putting Graham in contempt of court. If charges are brought against the company Graham could destroy the newspaper she sees as a family legacy. Alternately if she were to win any legal challenge the Post could instead establish itself as an important journalistic institution. She chooses to run the story.
The White House retaliates and in short order the Post and Times appear together before the Supreme Court to plead their First Amendment argument for the right to publish the material. Meanwhile newspapers across the country pick up the story in solidarity with the Post and Times. The court rules 6–3 in the newspapers' favor vindicating Graham's decision. Nixon demands that the Post should be barred from the White House. One year later security guard Frank Wills discovers a break-in in progress at the Watergate complex after a guest at the Watergate hotel called complaining about people using flashlights."
